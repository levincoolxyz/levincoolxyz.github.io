			<p>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://sites.usc.edu/kansolab/">Prof.Kanso's Bio-inspired Motion Lab</a> at USC. Previously I studied pure mathematics and astronautical engineering at <a href="https://utexas.edu"><strong><em>UT Austin</em></strong></a>. I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant at <a href="http://www.csr.utexas.edu/">Center for Space Research</a> for two years.</p>

			<p>I spend most of my time thinking about biology inspired physics problems, as I try to understand the mechanical aspects of emergent coordination across different life form. In particular, I use mathematical and computational tools to study problems that are <em>multi-scale</em> in nature, complex due to activity present in the system (active matter/out-of-equilibrium systems), and exhibit diverse behaviors that arise from conserved structures (multi-stability and bifurcation). The goal of my research is to seek the <strong>origins and mechanisms of diversity and coordination</strong> in complex systems, and establish the <strong>structure-to-function maps</strong> for such features.</p>
			<p>My PhD research has been focused on understanding the <strong>multi-scale coordination of cilia</strong>, the micron sized, hair-like structures that push fluid around to help cells move, and transport material for feeding, cleaning, filtration, and sensing. Notably, cilia are powered by nanoscale active elements (microtubule doublets and motor proteins) and can work <em>individually</em> as propellers for microorganisms, move in <em>single or a few pairs</em> analogous to appendages of mammals, or coordinate in <em>very large numbers</em> like on the epithelial tissue of mammalian brain ventricle, airway, and reproductive tracts.</p>
			<p>I am also excited to combine reinforcement learning (RL) with <em>analytically tractable</em> mathematical models to study <strong>decentralized control and collective motion</strong> problems, such as how ants organize to transport objects in groups, or schools of fish. In particular, how does specialization, hierarchy emerge? How does learning and group size/structure affect it?</p>
			<p>I have also retained interests in geometry and topology and I get easily excited by all work that happen to effectively use advanced mathematical concepts in 'real life' (e.g., discrete exterior calculus in graphics and simulation, persistent homology in data analysis). Space and sustainability techs are also always high up on my radar.</p>

I get easily excited by algebraic/differential geometry and topology techniques used in 'real' life (e.g. for <span title="click for my write up about exact conservation (mixed) methods"><a href="/paper/Application of DEC on MFEM.pdf">finite element analysis</a></span> and <span title="You should visit Prof.Keenan Crane's website if you haven't before!"><a href="https://youtu.be/mIUi1zIUQJw?t=3m42s">geometry processing</a></span> in general, or <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201101/rtx110100036p.pdf">persistent homology</a>, or <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01446v1">sheaf cohomology (!) for signal processing</a>), stochastic dynamics and estimations (<a href="http://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/">GN&C</a>, sensor fusion, computer vision, <a href="http://www.bostondynamics.com/" >robotics</a>, and UAVs), <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/">fluid mechanics</a>, <a href="http://the-earth-story.com/">rocks and geology</a>, <span title="spaaaaaace">space</span> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYsOHTQhS_vjFWQa31Lh4A">cosmology</a> (which makes the upcoming <a href="http://insight.jpl.nasa.gov/overview.cfm">Insight mission</a> a perfect combination), as well as the broad discipline of scientific computing, data analysis, and <a href="http://work.caltech.edu/library/">machine learning</a> (like <a href="https://deepart.io/">this</a>) ......</p> --->

				<p>The <a href="/fotos/duoduo.jpg">cutie</a> on the right is my adopted sister 多多, who is still living at my hometown, the <a href="http://ppcdn.500px.org/94138531/21b07ff790aadd89aeea7080fefb71163d93c0d1/2048.jpg">breathtakingly magnificent</a> <span title="literally, the yellow mountains"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangshan">黄山</a></span>.</p>
				<h4>Reading</h4>
				<p>Among my favourite books are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691118809/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">the Princeton Companion to Mathematics</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/048668735X/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Counterexamples in Topology</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486650677/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">the Variational Principles of Mechanics</a>, many more Dover (re)publications and other classics, such as things listed <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/Other/topologybooks.pdf">here</a> and at the end of May's A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology. Just go buy (me) something from my (old) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3K3FPYEL6YQYP/ref=topnav_lists_1">Amazon wishlist</a> :P</p>
				<p>And behold another <a href="http://arminstraub.com/math/what-is-column">set of gems</a> of mathematical exposition.</p>
				<!-- looks like somebody screwed up
				<p>And apparently "old" <a href="http://link.springer.com/search?facet-series=%22136%22&facet-content-type=%22Book%22&showAll=false">springer GTM books</a> are for free online!</p>
				-->
				<p>Maths aside, I find the <em>Road to Serfdom</em>, Crosby's <em>Ecological Imperialism</em>, and <em>the Massacre at El Mozote</em> to be good reads. I also love lots of Chinese classics from <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1519026/">说文解字</a>, an ancient treatise documenting <a href="http://www.chineseetymology.org/">Chinese Etymology</a> and things like 论语, to <a href="http://wx.ty2016.net/writer/jinyong.html">金庸的武侠小说</a>, famous 20<sup>th</sup> century martial art inspired fantasies... And I am in the process of digesting some works of 林语堂.</p>
				<p>And now an <a href="http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">essay</a> about programming.</p>
				<h4>Music</h4>
				<p>I play the piano (but a bit out of practice) and recently picked up some guitar action.</p>
				<p>Liszt, Rachmaninoff, and Bach are probably my most cherished composers. I love passion in the classical scales but also value precision, dignity, and complexity. My favourite pieces from them are Rhapsodie Espagnole, Liebestraum No.3, Consolation No.3, Hungarian Rhapsodies, and Rachmaninoff Piano Concertos, Prelude op.23 No.5, and the rhapsody. (It's pretty hard to pick favorites from Bach so I'm just gonna say Violin Partita No.2 plus all the fugues and inventions.) Beethoven's Symphony No.7 2nd mov., Etudes 'Revolutionary' of Chopin, Prokofiev's Piano Concerto op.26 No.3 1st mov., Bartok's Piano Concerto No.2 3rd mov. are also on my permanent playlist. My old <a href="http://www.optics.arizona.edu/academics/students/profile/dawson-baker">flatmate</a>(s) also forever made an impression of <a href="http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/">House/Techno/EDM</a> vibe into <a href="https://bandcamp.com/levincoolxyz#wishlist">my musical tastes</a>.</p>
				<h4>Other Stuff</h4>
				<p>I enjoy lifting weights and <a href="http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html">here</a> is a pretty great resource.</p>

				<p>Tinkering, manufacturing (the engineering guy has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMjtmsr3CqA">an awesome video on injection molding</a>), and rapid prototyping (additive mfg., laser techs, and good ol' CNC) have always fascinated me. I also love open source anything, from <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a> to <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">openSCAD</a> to farming (<a href="http://opensourceecology.org/">open source ecology</a>).</p>
