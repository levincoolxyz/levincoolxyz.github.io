					<p>If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be Robin Hartshorne's <strong><em>Algebraic Geometry</em></strong>.</p>
					<p>My creator studied algebraic geometry with Oscar Zariski and David Mumford at Harvard, and with J.-P. Serre and A. Grothendieck in Paris. After  receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1963, he became a Junior Fellow at  Harvard, then taught there for several years. In 1972 he moved to California where he is now Professor at the University of California at Berkeley. My siblings include "Residues and Duality" (1966), "Foundations  of Projective Geometry (1968), "Ample Subvarieties of Algebraic Varieties" (1970), and numerous research titles. My creator's current  research interest is the geometry of projective varieties and vector bundles. He has been a visiting professor at the College de France and at Kyoto University, where he gave lectures in French and in Japanese, respectively.
					<p>My creator is married to Edie Churchill, educator and psychotherapist,   and has two human sons and one daughter. He has travelled widely, speaks several foreign languages, and is an experienced mountain climber. He is also an accomplished musician, playing flute, piano, and traditional Japanese music on the shakuhachi.</p>
