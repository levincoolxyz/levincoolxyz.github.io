			<p>I was recently an undergrad at <a href="https://utexas.edu"><strong><em>UT Austin</em></strong></a>. I majored in Pure Mathematics and Astronautical Engineering. I also work as a research assistant at <a href="http://www.csr.utexas.edu/">Center for Space Research</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ae.utexas.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/bettadpur">Dr. Bettadpur</a>.</p>
			<p>My main areas of interest lies inside the <a href="/images/illuminati.png" >boundaries</a> of geometry, topology, and algebra. I also get easily excited by cool applications of algebraic and differential geometry and topology (e.g. for finite element analyses and <span title="You should visit Prof.Keenan Crane's website if you haven't before!"><a href="https://youtu.be/mIUi1zIUQJw?t=3m42s">geometry processing</a></span> in general), stochastic estimation and control (sensor fusion, computer vision, Robotics, and UAVs), <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/">fluid dynamics</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheEarthStory">rocks related stuff</a>, as well as the broad discipline of scientific computing and machine learning.</p>

				<p>The cutie on the right is my adopted sister 多多, who is still living at my hometown, the <a href="http://ppcdn.500px.org/94138531/21b07ff790aadd89aeea7080fefb71163d93c0d1/2048.jpg">breathtakingly magnificent</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangshan">黄山</a>.</p>
				<h4>Reading</h4>
				<p>Among my favourite books are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691118809/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">the Princeton Companion to Mathematics</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/048668735X/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Counterexamples in Topology</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486650677/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">the Variational Principles of Mechanics</a>, many more Dover (re)publications and other classic texts, such as things listed <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/Other/topologybooks.pdf">here</a> and at the end of May's A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology. Just go buy (me) something from my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3K3FPYEL6YQYP/ref=topnav_lists_1">Amazon wishlist</a> :P</p>
				<p>Behold another <a href="http://arminstraub.com/math/what-is-column">good collection</a> of fun math expositions.</p>
				<p>Maths aside, I find <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811875423/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">the Cloud Collector's Handbook</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Serfdom-Documents---Definitive-Collected/dp/0226320553/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1420456736&sr=1-1&keywords=road+to+serfdom">the Road to Serfdom</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seventies-American-Culture-Society-Politics/dp/030681126X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1420456796&sr=1-1&keywords=the+seventies">the Seventies</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Massacre-at-El-Mozote/dp/067975525X">the Massacre at El Mozote</a> to be good reads. I also love lots of Chinese classics from <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1519026/">说文解字</a>, an ancient treatise documenting <a href="http://www.chineseetymology.org/">Chinese Etymology</a>, to <a href="http://wx.ty2016.net/writer/jinyong.html">金庸的武侠小说</a>, famous 20<sup>th</sup> century martial art fantasies... Speaking of which, I should really start reading more of 林语堂.</p>
				<p>And now an <a href="http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">essay</a> about programming.</p>
				<h4>Music</h4>
				<p>I play the piano (but kinda out of practice now) and recently picked up some guitar action.</p>
				<p>Listz and Rachmaninoff are probably my most cherished composers. My favourite pieces from them are Rhapsodie Espagnole, Liebestraum No.3, Consolation No.3, Hungarian Rhapsodies No. 2 and 6, and Piano Concerto No.1,2,3 Prelude op.23 No.5, Rachmaninoff Rhapsody. Beethoven's Symphony No.7 2nd mov., Etudes 'Revolutionary' of Chopin, Prokofiev's Piano Concerto op.26 No.3 1st mov., Bartok's Piano Concerto No.2 3rd mov., Albinoni's famous Adagio in G minor, and Bach's Violin Partita No.2 as well as his fugues and inventions are also on my permanent playlist. My old <a href="http://www.optics.arizona.edu/academics/students/profile/dawson-baker">flatmate</a> also forever made an impression of <a href="https://thedrop.club/?genre=deep%2Bdnb%2Bhardstyle%2Btechno">House/Techno EDM vibe</a> into my muscial tastes.</p>
				<h4>Hobbies</h4>
				<p>I enjoy lifting weights and <a href="http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html">this</a> is a great resource.</p>
				<p>You can also read all about my opinions on selected motion pictures for the past few years or so under the <a href="/movrev">"Other/Film Reviews"</a> tab above.</p>
				<p>There is some amateur photography under the <a href="/fotos">"Other/Photos"</a> tab.</p> 
				<p>I've been using (and occasionally contributing to) <a href="http://forvo.com/">Forvo</a> for awhile now.</p>
				<p>Finally a few <a href="quotes.html">quotes</a> I like.</p>
