			<p><strong>CV</strong>: <a href="/cv/Ling,Feng - cv.pdf">updated on July 24, 2023</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Research Statement</strong>: <a href="/cv/Research_Statement.pdf">updated on October 25, 2021</a>.</p>

			<p>I am a Postdoc at <a href="https://www.pioneercampus.org/themenmenue-links/about-us0/principal-investigators/janna-nawroth/index.html">Dr. Janna Nawroth's Mechanobiology Lab</a> in Helmholtz Pioneer Campus (part of HMGU Munich) in Germany. I completed my PhD studying cilia mechanics at USC in <a href="https://sites.usc.edu/kansolab/">Prof.Kanso's Bio-inspired Motion Lab</a>. I studied pure mathematics and astronautical engineering as an undergraduate at <a href="https://utexas.edu"><strong><em>UT Austin</em></strong></a>. I also previously worked as a research assistant at <a href="http://www.csr.utexas.edu/">Center for Space Research</a>.</p>

			<p>I spend most of my time searching for semblances of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universality_class">universality</a> in the extremely diverse world of biology. I am specifically specialized in looking at things from the lens of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_bifurcation">mechanical instabilities</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistability">bistabilities</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergent</a> coordination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_matter">living matter</a> across different time and length scales. The end goal, in addition hopefully some impactful engineering and biomedical applications, is to enhance our understanding of how biological structure and morphology shapes and gets shaped by its function(s).</p>

			<p>Tool wise, I am relatively well-versed in mathematical and computational modeling (e.g., elasto-hydrodyanmics of filaments, reinforcement learning with PPO), and is currently expanding my skillset to include standard experimental methods such as lab-grade bright-field microscopy.</p>

			<p>My research currently focus on the topic of <strong>cilia</strong>. Cilia, the micron sized, hair-like protrusions of Eukaryotic cells, (1) are powered by thousands of nanoscale active elements (dynein motors); (2) can sense its mechanical and chemical environments; (3) can push fluid around to help cells move, and transport material; (4) exhibit diverse oscillatory motion as propellers for microorganisms; (5) appear in large groups and coordinate to perform crucial biological functions such as power the clearance of particulate matter inside airway, brain ventricle, and reproductive tracts.</p>

			<p>Another topic that interests me scientifically is how can we leverage state-of-the-art machine learning tools <em>and</em> analytical tractable models to study how specialization and hierarchy emerge in (decentralized) control? And how do things like group size and topology affect group behavior, organization and learning?</p>
			
			<p>I am also always down to chat about any 'advanced' geometry and topology and their applications in 'real life' (e.g., discrete exterior calculus in computer graphics, persistent homology for data analysis), outer space, and sustainability technologies.</p>

I get easily excited by algebraic/differential geometry and topology techniques used in 'real' life (e.g. for <span title="click for my write up about exact conservation (mixed) methods"><a href="/paper/Application of DEC on MFEM.pdf">finite element analysis</a></span> and <span title="You should visit Prof.Keenan Crane's website if you haven't before!"><a href="https://youtu.be/mIUi1zIUQJw?t=3m42s">geometry processing</a></span> in general, or <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201101/rtx110100036p.pdf">persistent homology</a>, or <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01446v1">sheaf cohomology (!) for signal processing</a>), stochastic dynamics and estimations (<a href="http://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/">GN&C</a>, sensor fusion, computer vision, <a href="http://www.bostondynamics.com/" >robotics</a>, and UAVs), <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/">fluid mechanics</a>, <a href="http://the-earth-story.com/">rocks and geology</a>, <span title="spaaaaaace">space</span> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYsOHTQhS_vjFWQa31Lh4A">cosmology</a> (which makes the upcoming <a href="http://insight.jpl.nasa.gov/overview.cfm">Insight mission</a> a perfect combination), as well as the broad discipline of scientific computing, data analysis, and <a href="http://work.caltech.edu/library/">machine learning</a> (like <a href="https://deepart.io/">this</a>) ......</p> --->

				<p>The <a href="/fotos/duoduo.jpg">cutie</a> on the right is my adopted sister 多多, who is still living at my hometown, the <a href="http://ppcdn.500px.org/94138531/21b07ff790aadd89aeea7080fefb71163d93c0d1/2048.jpg">breathtakingly magnificent</a> <span title="literally, the yellow mountains"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangshan">黄山</a></span>.</p>
				<h4>Reading</h4>
				<p>Among my favourite books are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691118809/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">the Princeton Companion to Mathematics</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/048668735X/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Counterexamples in Topology</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486650677/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">the Variational Principles of Mechanics</a>, many more Dover (re)publications and other classics, such as things listed <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/Other/topologybooks.pdf">here</a> and at the end of May's A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology. Just go buy (me) something from my (old) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3K3FPYEL6YQYP/ref=topnav_lists_1">Amazon wishlist</a> :P</p>
				<p>And behold another <a href="http://arminstraub.com/math/what-is-column">set of gems</a> of mathematical exposition.</p>
				<!-- looks like somebody screwed up
				<p>And apparently "old" <a href="http://link.springer.com/search?facet-series=%22136%22&facet-content-type=%22Book%22&showAll=false">springer GTM books</a> are for free online!</p>
				-->
				<p>Maths aside, I find the <em>Road to Serfdom</em>, Crosby's <em>Ecological Imperialism</em>, and <em>the Massacre at El Mozote</em> to be good reads. I also love lots of Chinese classics from <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1519026/">说文解字</a>, an ancient treatise documenting <a href="http://www.chineseetymology.org/">Chinese Etymology</a> and things like 论语, to <a href="http://wx.ty2016.net/writer/jinyong.html">金庸的武侠小说</a>, famous 20<sup>th</sup> century martial art inspired fantasies... And I am in the process of digesting some works of 林语堂.</p>
				<p>And now an <a href="http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">essay</a> about programming.</p>
				<h4>Music</h4>
				<p>I play the piano (but a bit out of practice) and recently picked up some guitar action.</p>
				<p>Liszt, Rachmaninoff, and Bach are probably my most cherished composers. I love passion in the classical scales but also value precision, dignity, and complexity. My favourite pieces from them are Rhapsodie Espagnole, Liebestraum No.3, Consolation No.3, Hungarian Rhapsodies, and Rachmaninoff Piano Concertos, Prelude op.23 No.5, and the rhapsody. (It's pretty hard to pick favorites from Bach so I'm just gonna say Violin Partita No.2 plus all the fugues and inventions.) Beethoven's Symphony No.7 2nd mov., Etudes 'Revolutionary' of Chopin, Prokofiev's Piano Concerto op.26 No.3 1st mov., Bartok's Piano Concerto No.2 3rd mov. are also on my permanent playlist. My old <a href="http://www.optics.arizona.edu/academics/students/profile/dawson-baker">flatmate</a>(s) also forever made an impression of <a href="http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/">House/Techno/EDM</a> vibe into <a href="https://bandcamp.com/levincoolxyz#wishlist">my musical tastes</a>.</p>
				<h4>Other Stuff</h4>
				<p>I enjoy lifting weights and <a href="http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html">here</a> is a pretty great resource.</p>
				<p>You can also read all about my thoughts on some shows and pictures for the past few years or so <a href="/movrev">here</a>. There also exists some amateur photography by me over <a href="/fotos">here</a> as well.</p>

				<p>If you have never heard of <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/designer/oskar_van_deventer">Oskar van Deventer</a>, you should certainly check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OskarPuzzle">his YouTube channel of puzzles</a>.</p>
				<p>And speaking of YouTubers, go watch something from Brady's <a href="http://www.numberphile.com/">NumberPhile</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtwKon9qMt5YLVgQt1tvJKg">Objectivity</a> channels and other math stuff from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3blue1brown</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PulitzerCenter">The Pulitzer Center</a> also put up some videos that deserve more views than it has.</p>
				<p>Tinkering, manufacturing (the engineering guy has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMjtmsr3CqA">an awesome video on injection molding</a>), and rapid prototyping (additive mfg., laser techs, and good ol' CNC) have always fascinated me. I also love open source anything, from <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a> to <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">openSCAD</a> to farming (<a href="http://opensourceecology.org/">open source ecology</a>).</p>

				<p>This <a href="http://google-calendar-hours.com/">Google calendar hours calculator</a> comes in handy at times. So has this <a href="http://youcanbook.me">scheduling tool</a> if you are a fellow Google calendar junkie like me.</p>
				<p>I have also been learning French and German (mostly) through <a href="http://duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> for some time now. <a href="http://ielanguages.com/">ielanguages</a> also have some pretty cool lessons (esp. on French pronunciation for me).</p>
