			<p>I'm an undergraduate student at <a href="https://utexas.edu"><strong><em>UT Austin</em></strong></a>. I am majoring in Pure Mathematics and Aerospace Engineering (Astronautics). I also work as an undergraduate research assistant at <a href="http://www.csr.utexas.edu/">Center for Space Research</a>.</p>
			<p>My main areas of interest lies inside the <a href="/images/illuminati.png" >boundaries</a> of geometry, topology, and algebra. Click <a href="activity.html">here</a> to check out what I am up to right now. I am also interested in applications of algebraic and differential geometry and topology (in Finite Element Methods and <span title="You should visit Prof.Keenan Crane's website if you haven't before!"><a href="https://youtu.be/mIUi1zIUQJw?t=3m42s">geometry processing</a></span> in general), stochastic estimation and control (sensor fusion, computer vision, Robotics, and UAVs), as well as the broad discipline of scientific computing and machine learning.</p>

				<p>Among my favourite books are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691118809/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">the Princeton Companion to Mathematics</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/048668735X/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Counterexamples in Topology</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486650677/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">the Variational Principles of Mechanics</a>, and many more Dover (re)publications + other classic texts and notes (e.g. things listed <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/Other/topologybooks.pdf">here</a>, or just buy me something from my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3K3FPYEL6YQYP/ref=topnav_lists_1">Amazon wishlist</a>). Maths aside, I enjoyed going thru <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811875423/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">the Cloud Collector's Handbook</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Serfdom-Documents---Definitive-Collected/dp/0226320553/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1420456736&sr=1-1&keywords=road+to+serfdom">the Road to Serfdom</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seventies-American-Culture-Society-Politics/dp/030681126X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1420456796&sr=1-1&keywords=the+seventies">the Seventies</a>, plus many Chinese classics (from <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1519026/">说文解字</a>, an ancient treatise documenting <a href="http://www.chineseetymology.org/">Chinese Etymology</a>, to <a href="http://wx.tianyabook.org/writer/jinyong.html">金庸的武侠小说</a>, famous 20<sup>th</sup> century martial art fantasies)...</p>

				<p>Listz and Rachmaninoff are probably my most cherished composers. My favourite pieces from them are Rhapsodie Espagnole, Liebestraum No.3, Consolation No.3, Hungarian Rhapsodies No. 2 and 6, and Piano Concerto No.1,2,3 Prelude op.23 No.5, Rachmaninoff Rhapsody. Beethoven's Symphony No.7 2nd mov., Etudes 'Revolutionary' of Chopin, Prokofiev's Piano Concerto op.26 No.3 1st mov., Bartok's Piano Concerto No.2 3rd mov., Albinoni's famous Adagio in G minor, and Bach's Violin Partita No.2 as well as his fugues and inventions are also on my permanent playlist. My old <a href="http://www.optics.arizona.edu/academics/students/profile/dawson-baker">flatmate</a> also forever made an impression of <a href="https://thedrop.club/?genre=deep%2Bdnb%2Bhardstyle%2Btechno">House/Techno EDM vibe</a> into my muscial tastes.</p>
				<p>I also like lifting weights and <a href="http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html">this</a> is a great resource.</p>
				<p>You can also read all about my opinions on selected motion pictures for the past few years or so under Other/Film Reviews.</p>
				<p>Behold a good <a href="http://arminstraub.com/math/what-is-column">collection</a> of fun math readings (List by Dr. Armin Straub).</p>
