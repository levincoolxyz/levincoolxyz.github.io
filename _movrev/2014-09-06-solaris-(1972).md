empathy and sympathy

fresh perspective

fitting soundtrack

expected outcome
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)

untraceable (natural) acting

#COMMENTS:

cool story bro

have some philosophical implications on the "point" of reality. and what is self. it is perception or "truth"

need to watch again without distraction later probably.
