#TAGS:
empathy and sympathy

fresh perspective
clich√© message

excellent camera work

unexpected outcome
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)

untraceable (natural) acting
#COMMENTS:
Just a silly story about a silly old man. The vast majority of the story is hard to watch (very boring and quite predictable) but the ending was reasonable and good.





SCORE:
9
