#COMMENTS:
It's pretty hilarious/sad how the "technology" is so advanced yet the doctors are still using their bare hands... There's a first degree proof of human are still suprerior (in the film's setting).

detroit still exists!

Samuel Jackson's role is complete crap. It's like 100 times worse than some tv personality nowadays like Billy'O Reilly, except with a weird agenda and bias (he clearly want "low crime" rate, yet the very doctor that makes things available he is also against? what? he just likes machines and cursing on tv so much?).

And as always, machine are coded by human, and by letting machine running around doing law enforcement jobs, it is no different than having people do it except with different efficiency ratings at different phases of clearing a case. At least they should this point a bit in having the executives code themselves as "red asset."

And Murphy died in the orginal? that sounds interesting. have to watch some time.
