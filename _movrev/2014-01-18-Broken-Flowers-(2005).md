#COMMENTS:

The film has some good symbolism throughout. But it is mostly presenting a problem without giving suggestions or solutions (and this is only a problem as I consider this a social comentary).
The plot development was a bit slow with many well placed silent scenes. In retrospect, not a good idea to watch this right before sleep at 2am since I couldn't possibly use those time to reflect (too tired). And this seems to demonstrate an emptiness felt by Don Johnston.
Couple interesting things:
1. Don always turn down Winston's offer/plan very affirmtively but then execute exactly.
2. The different ex-es seems to represent different outlook on life. The first is the carefree live in the present, second the worrisome and dull life with suppressed feelings for stability and gain, third the condesending stage after being through a carthasis of some crisis (lesbian hint? touch on the waist and returning of the flowers), fourth the isolated self protection, fifth well death.
3. the whole plot seems to be an intentional farcical.
4. basket ball stands for all the families. yet there are no son.
Does the sport jacket represents Don's immaturity as all the youngster wore them?
