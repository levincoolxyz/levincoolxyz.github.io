#COMMENTS:
"hump the hostess"
As someone else pointed out on an IMDB discussion board, people whom never been exposed to such damaging relationships are unlikely able to get the message. Maybe I am too lucky to be born and thrive in functional families.
The moment when I sort of realized that the son was invented was strange. I could not grasp at all why is that the case (why is it necessary for them to invent such a thing) until I read on how this film is also trying depicting the childless families. I suppose I can understand a bit how the conflict of wanting a child, afraid or cannot bare one is.
The beginning (before it all turned dark and shit) had some funny scenes.
