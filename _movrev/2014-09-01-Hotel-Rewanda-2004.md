#COMMENTS:

great acting by the cast. almost as informative as the reading from Harris' class. the only missing piece is the drama in the states as described smantha power. but the omission is reasonable for the sake of the protagnist storyline. the additional information from the movie is that the story of Belgium separation of the Hutu and Tutsi. the fact it was arbitrary from "scientific" racism and the stupid shit on giving one power until they left is pretty sad.

the UN chief is portrayed in a rather one-dimentional manner. maybe it was very accurate, as he had to remain composed to perform tactically. sadly his "ending" was easily the most moving thing in the reading. but his scene at the bar was phenomenal regardless.

the red cross lady was a nice touch. wonder how truthful that was.

not much dynamic on the side of the "Hutu" militia. I suppose this with the combination of "the act of killing" would be the defining cinematic pieces on human genocide.
