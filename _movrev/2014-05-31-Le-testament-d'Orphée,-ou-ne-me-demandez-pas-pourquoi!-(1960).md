#TAGS:
thought provoking thinking

fresh perspective
did not get it
layered meaning (good for over-thinking/multiple viewing)

excellent camera work
immersive atmosphere

expected outcome
intricate storyline (what the fuck just happened? have to read elsewhere or re-watch)

untraceable (natural) acting
dramatic acting

#COMMENTS:

I don't know what really happened. I think the flower should be an important metaphor. It's oddly enjoyable (locally all the plots and conversations make sense but I cannot understand the whole thing fully.)
