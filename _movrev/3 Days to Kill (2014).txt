silly humor

this is pointless (either I can't find a point or I disagree whole-heartedly)

immersive atmosphere

expected outcome
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)

intense action

untraceable (natural) acting

#COMMENTS:

very generic action film. had 1 laugh. plots are a bit convoluted and unrealistic as usual. characters are weird and jumpy emotionally. some cuts are very abrupt. reasonable actions.
