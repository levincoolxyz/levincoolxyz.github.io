	<h1>Current Activities</h1>
	<p>This page is as much of a status update as a personal agenda/reminder......</p>
	<p><em>Updated 05/10/2016</em></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Work</h2>
	<p>Still working on the discrete 2d inverse spectral problem for/with <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/evouga/">Prof. Etienne Vouga</a> and now also <a href="http://keenan.is/here">Prof. Keenan Crane</a>. some preliminary results are <a href="/invspec">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Very sad that the classes are over now. But will tag along <a href="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/efontes/">Ernie</a>'s homotopy theory 'learning seminar' over the summer.</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Readings (mildly hindered by a lack of UT library privileges)</h2>
	<h4>Dynamics/Control/(bio)locomotion/Motion planning</h4>
	<p>still just exploring the literature</p>

	<h4>Topology!</h4>
	<p>never gonna give May's super concise course up</p>
	<p>still around chapter 2 of Adam's infinite loop spaces</p>
	<p>intermittently reading Bott and Tu's forms in AT, Milnor's char classes and morse theory, cohomology operations, algebraic operads, the wild world of 4 mflds ...</p>

	<h4>Algebraic Geometry</h4>
	<p>maybe work some Shafarevich/Hartshorne again now equipped with BenZvi's 'basket'...</p>
	<p>bits and pieces (mostly the chapter about Gröbner basis) of Eisenbud's Comm. Alg.</p>
	<p>Viosin's Hodge theory as well as reviewing some of Higgs Bundle notes</p>

	<h4>Other</h4>
	<p>reading about topological signal processing vs. sheaf cohomology </p>
	<p>noncommutative geometry notes?</p>
	<p>Daniel Chupin's undergrad thesis on heat kernel proof of the AS index theorem</p>
	<p>continue Lieb & Seiringer's stability of matter in QM</p>
	<p>review Freed's K-theory class, and also read more of Atiyah's book</p>
	<p>review Gompf's 4-mfd class and his book, complementing with Akbulut's lecture notes. I will know how to Kirby calculus one day!</p>
	<p>review notes and references from Gunningham's D-module class</p>
	<p>get the point of pointless topology</p>
	<p>keep on slogging thru the "What is" columns compilation and the Princeton Companion...</p>

	<p>Also see <a href="/todo.html">a list of concepts to be tackled.</a></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2>
	<p>going to get clean/jerk/snatch down this summer. Also some boxing basics.</p>
	<p>try to rigorously explain when are repetitions of simple K'nex angle joints planar</p>
	<p>Learn España Cañí, Sting's the last ship, Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Radiohead's Street Spirit, and perfect ze Spanish Romance (cf. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5tEd16aBCY">this performance</a>).</p>
	<p>restart regular piano practices</p>
	<p>figure out how to work genus 2 Dehn twists to beat Teruaki</p>
	<p>organize photos, finish the photography page, make an "album" on just the metal earth models...</p>
	<p>keep hoarding facts from past Ig-noble prizes. <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/282526/3/MO_1007.pdf">this</a> one is my favorite yet. I wonder how does hunger factor into decision making. I image it would stop inhibitors on impulsive actions?<br/>
	Interestingly, my questions about <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxMc7PG7EAt-RjN4Y2pRODB3XzA">a hair curling procedure</a> led me to the pony tail dynamics Ig-noble prizes</p>
	<p>A very long IMDb watch list (469 and counting...)</p>
