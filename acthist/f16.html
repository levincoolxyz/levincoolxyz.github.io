	<h1>Current Activities</h1>
	<p>This page is as much of a status update as a personal agenda/reminder......</p>
	<p><em>Updated 08/22/2016</em></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Work/Research</h2>
	<p>I am the TA for AME 310 Thermodynamics. My Office Hours are Wed 12-2pm and Thu 10-11am. The discussion section will be Wed 5-6pm.</p>
	<p>Supervised by/joint with <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/evouga/">Prof. Etienne Vouga</a> and <a href="http://keenan.is/here">Prof. Keenan Crane</a>, the discrete inverse spectral problem on closed g=0 surfaces. We have had some good preliminary results for simplicial meshes but now we are trying things "mesh-free" in the spherical harmonic basis. Project page is <a href="/invspec">here</a>.</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Readings (I hope USC library has a good selection)</h2>
	<h4>Dynamics/Control/(bio)locomotion/Motion planning</h4>
	<p>Waiting for directives to explore more literature</p>

	<h4>For Leisure (e.g. pure math)</h4>
	<p>Riemann Zeta Function by Edwards</p>
	<p>maybe will have to give up May's super concise course eventually</p>
	<p>of course still intermittently on Adam's infinite loop spaces, Bott and Tu's forms in AT, Milnor's char classes and morse theory, cohomology operations, algebraic operads, the wild world of 4 mflds ...</p>
	<p>will revisit summer AG seminar notes/Vakil/Shafarevich/Hartshorne if I get free time. Would like to retain BenZvi's 'basket' as long as possible...</p>
	<p>bits and pieces (mostly the chapter about Gröbner basis) of Eisenbud's Comm. Alg.</p>
	<p>Viosin's Hodge theory and reviewing some of Higgs Bundle notes</p>
	<p>sheaf cohomology in topological signal processing </p>
	<p>noncommutative geometry</p>
	<p>Daniel Chupin's heat kernel AS index thesis</p>
	<p>K-theory: Freed's class note and Antiyah's book and Quillen's side of the story</p>
	<p>I really want to get to know 4-mflds better. Gompf's book, notes, and that of Akbulut's. Kirby calculus will be conquered</p>
	<p>get the point of pointless topology</p>
	<p>Lieb & Seiringer's stability of matter in QM</p>
	<p>"What is" columns and the Princeton Companion are now officially my bedtime stories...</p>

	<p>Also see <a href="/todo.html">a list of concepts to be tackled.</a></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2>
	<p>Will show up regularly to DTLAW for olympic liftings (took me a summer to learn clean&jerk but seems to have gotten the basic snatch down during 1 free lesson) and keep up powerlifting basics at Lyon. Maybe will join the USC boxing/climbing clubs here later.</p>
	<p>try to rigorously explain when are repetitions of simple K'nex angle joints planar</p>
	<p>Musical instruments are on a pause. Need to find used guitar and places to practice piano ASAP</p>
	<p>A very long IMDb watch list (now it's 500+ after a summer of MUBI... HOW?!) Not to mention free screenings on campus. so probably should pause MUBI for now. </p>
