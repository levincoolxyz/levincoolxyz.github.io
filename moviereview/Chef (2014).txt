#COMMENTS:

generic feel good comedy as another imdb-er said.

the part where chef went nuts at the reviewer is absolutely melodramatic theatrics. i thought he figured it out and was going to bring the food he made at home to him individually... i mean how to you expect other people to change their (even if shitty) opinion if you show no **new** evidence?!

how the fuck can the food critic sell his website for money? the website would worth shit if he left... I don't get it.

that twitter sound annoyed me.

and why the fuck can't the resturant add new items to the menu *while* keeping the good old customer favorites?????!!!!! and to the least changing the menu or making a small dish for a critic should be acceptable! horribly run business by the "owner"

good acting and all, except some characters are so out-of-place (ex-wife's ex-husband, publicists etc.)
