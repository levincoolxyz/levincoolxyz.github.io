#COMMENTS:

disney tried hard to make maleficent an interesting character, ironically though, in order to keep the general story progression straight, she is the most "human" (complex) character in the entire film. Everyone else behaved very linear, constant, without much conflicts. (I suppose stephen raising the knife and dropping added a bit of struggle, but there was no regret or appeasement of any kind after the curse?)

in general, however, the development is rather lagging and unengaging (still better than England's football performance. OOOOOOOOOOOO) for an over-thinking adult like me.
