fresh perspective

acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)

untraceable (natural) acting

#COMMENTS:

humans do not change suddenly for no obvious fucking reason. out of nowhere Marina just accepted him and soon "fell in love" after seeing him beaten up... wtf! that's not how stockholm syndrome etc works. even if something of that caliber could happen in the real movie time, complicated thought process must have happened inside and the film did not portray that gradual change at all. other than that it's cool. overall the pace of the film is just rushed.

also the classic unrealistic stolen car startup scene.

and marina is rather retarded as a hostage (initially I guess). the fucking throwing glass scene and not seeing through the 假昧... sigh

a bit naive and extremely lucky but an alright story.
