#COMMENTS:
Mildly enjoyable teen comedy/drama. A positive message, but it is given way too strongly and directly. Instead of presenting a moving story and make me make my own connections and realisations, the idea is more or less shoved into my ears. So it makes it less real and entertaining.
I'm not used to Aubrey Plaza acting as a fairly positive character.
