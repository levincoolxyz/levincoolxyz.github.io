#COMMENTS:

very interesting discussion on belief/life/purpose/religion/hope. good backgroud (crusade/black plague) setting with great characters. upon initial viewing, the squire might be the most appealing character, but I believe there is some level of symbolism on the guy with most insights (knight) not so outspeaking. need to rewatch sometime for a more detailed analysis on characters and meanings.

a couple of interesting quotes: you always sit on your own arse; love is the most perfect imperfection of this imperfect world; both paraphrased from the squire.

the dialogue with death in church was especially interesting. and the fact that death dresses so similar to the priests/monks... ha

don't quite understand the actor bit. and the meaning of the very end (they walk on the hill funny). I suppose the point of the knight's delay/purpose that he found at last is that he protected the acrobats' kid.

oh and they ate wild strawberries. lol
