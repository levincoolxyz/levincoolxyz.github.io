#COMMENTS:

very quirky film (as one would expect from woody allen). classic cinematic discussion on stardom/celeberty, progression/growth of an artist, and passion in relationship. nice humor/sarcasm from time to time. not very enjoyable, ironically as predicted by the film itself (I watched all your films and I especially like the earlier funny ones).
