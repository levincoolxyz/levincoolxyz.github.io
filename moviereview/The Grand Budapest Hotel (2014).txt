#COMMENTS:

This is such a cute story. the key points of Miser Gustave's moderness (his vision of civilness) is convincingly depicted by his style and esp. his apology to Zero.

the format of narration is rather classical, and the plot line evolves nicely but generically, so normally I would've give it a 7. Except when he mentioned Agatha's passing, moisture filled up my eyes quick. It was just such a normal, unexciting yet dreadfully sorrow and relatable loss through an uncontrollable disease of the time. It moved me in precisely the same way that the snapshot of the old guy's life in 'Up!' did.

some special effects are very, I suppose intentionally, cartonish.
