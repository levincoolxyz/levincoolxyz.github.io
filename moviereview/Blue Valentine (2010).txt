#COMMENTS:
this film pointed out many flaws that common relationship have. The IMDB discussion boards have several good post on the specifics.

key idea is about immaturity. Sometime its the immature and fun side of people that attracts you in the first place, yet the same immaturity would drive people apart eventually because of all the tediousness.

The car scene made me feel that Dean is a huge emotional baby/bitch. Although learning about the past later on justified his reactions a bit more, it's still pretty over the top.

the fact that jasmine become incapable of accepting Dean's ambition-less qualities, as someone else pointed out, could be a projection of her own failure at becoming a doctor doctor.

No doubt that Dean sacrificed a lot by agreeing to merry her (but keep in mind he also benefited from it because he liked it), but he should not just keep the same level or even become sloppier at being a lover. Look at his appearence. It's disappointing at least
