#COMMENTS:  
  
shocking that this is very close to the true accounts(as far as I had investigated). And this is what I would call an appropriate dramatic adaptation. It is still exaggerating but many times better than what happened in the imitation game.  
  
However, the film is intentially leading the audience to think that there was evidence of faul play for his death. He had his personal demons (think birdman), and his letters really did convince his family (and me) to believe that it was suicide.  
  
One thing that was bothing me was the lack of recordings for friendly sources (e.g. the banker). Maybe it was a cost/technology constraint of the time but that would really make or kill his story once and for all.
