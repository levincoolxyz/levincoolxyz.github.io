#COMMENTS:  
  
Mr. Robert Oelman's life, although sounded almost a trope of mid-life crisis, really resonants well with the lesson from the Ju/'hoansi. The very existence of the common phenomenon of life crisis comes from struggling with wants that are not really what we wanted, but what our society attached to us.  
  
Although there's the question that begs to be asked, How could he afford such a lifestyle (at least in the beginning) if not for his earlier career and other more institutional favourtisms? (yes i'm talking about colonialism, industrial revolution, scientific revolution, cold war (whose residuals are main causes for many south american unrest and economic difficulties)...)  
  
Quibble: the editing could take more work. many messages were repeated in not so elegant fashion (i.e. a bit lectury and annoying). some interviews of family members seem a bit unnecessary.
