#COMMENTS:  
  
lesson: do not drink when pregnant. This is fundamentally a story of how to cope with mentally-illed / overly obsessive/dominant partner in a relationship.  
  
And the plot development can't be more hollywoody.  
  
But the inclusion of an advanced machine learning system is still relevant. Especially given the key moment of AlphaGo is leading Lee Sedo by 4 to 1. All in all, the point is that we are still not at the stage where a computer system can be developed to be as good of a generalist as ordinary human beings. They are still inferior hence our slaves.  
  
Some of the plays were good.
