#COMMENTS:  
  
Dale's story made the judge looked so much more like an asshole in the beginning, gave the story a more unconvincing hollywood twist  
  
seems to be a role tailored for Robert D Jr . he's showing up like the same person all over the place now. don't make me hate you like I hate morgan freeman.  
  
story is a bit cliche especially consider so many disfunctional family funeral things I've watched already. but it got a bit more interesting pass when I realize why henry was "banished" (as his daughter asked about the trophies)
