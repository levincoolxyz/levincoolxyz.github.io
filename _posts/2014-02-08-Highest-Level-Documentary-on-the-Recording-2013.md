#COMMENTS:  
  
watching 朗朗 in this music production film/video, his great optism, confidence and passion made me think maybe my deire to contribute actually "impoartant" (in a way that I interpret) work to the world is more of a form of hubris and gluttony than being responsible. Because the fact is no matter how little I think of what his accomplishing is influencing our grand antropological struggle in this universe, he is definitely make a smedge of impact. And to think that what he's doing is not "important" or how I want to/ can be more "important" is no different than thinking I'm "better" and/or more "capable."  
  
it's suprising to know how the artists can't feel that andrenaline rush when confronted by a recorder instead of an audience. I guess I'm just inexperienced.
