#COMMENTS:  
  
You went because you think they are different, but you stayed because they are the same.  
  
some interesting colonialism/immigration symbolisms and a fair exploration of true meaning of civilization.  
  
the plot development is, however, very much stuck in the family film genre and unenlightening.
