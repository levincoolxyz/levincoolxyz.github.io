Although with its own merits, this film is largely inaccurate in its presentation of Turing's true character. It turns him into a passive victim of the society rather than a hero who fought back the best he could. In fact he was humorous and loved to most of everyone he met (only to whoever he likes in his later years) and his WWII effort was very much so collaborative from the get go.
