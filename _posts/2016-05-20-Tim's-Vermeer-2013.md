#COMMENTS:  
  
People tend to think there's somehow an unbridgeable gap between art and science/technology, but this documentary is a great counter-demonstration. In fact, mathematics, the cornerstone of (modern) technologies (e.g. optics), is itself an art! Now I feel even less bad to use internet resources and GIMP aiding my silly graphical designs.  
  
I do however take issue with how Tim was actually obsessed with recreating one of Vermeer's scene (although I suppose an elephant walked into the room briefly), if it were to me (being already successful like him) I would simply show people the optical construct (let people decide for themselves what was the most plausible history), and go use it to paint a more original set-up.
