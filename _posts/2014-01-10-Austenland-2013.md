#COMMENTS:

it was quite obvious how the chauffeur/servant was going to be Jane's planned "happy ending" since it not only matches the theme of the time (a poor lady with a man of lower status) but also because it's an easier to implement ploy (after all, the organizer should expect most people to be into "Mr. Darcy" so he can't be set to fall for anyone particular (like how agencies as favorable actors to remain single publically)). Anyway, there are some funny scenes but some characters are over-acted.

one notable thing is the selection of soundtracks for the credit. it was very fun and appropriate.
