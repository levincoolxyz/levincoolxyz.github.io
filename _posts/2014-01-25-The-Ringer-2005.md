this is pointless (either I can't find a point or I disagree whole-heartedly)

expected outcome

untraceable (natural) acting

#COMMENTS:
Just one of those "laughing with" the retards film. Some funny lines/acts but quite boring and predictable plots.

"I heard it rains in Seattle."
"Yeah sometimes."
