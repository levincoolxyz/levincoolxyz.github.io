#TAGS:  
physical comedy  
funny  
  
this is pointless (either I can't find a point or I disagree whole-heartedly)  
  
expected outcome  
  
untraceable (natural) acting  
  
#COMMENTS:  
Just one of those "laughing with" the retards film. Some funny lines/acts but quite boring and predictable plots.  
  
"I heard it rains in Seattle."  
"Yeah sometimes."
