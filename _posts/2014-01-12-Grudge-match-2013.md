#COMMENTS:
The movie is quite fun. I especially like the kid and the old grumpy coach character. How can anyone hold a grudging face when an 8 yr old is talking about getting a BJ (Butterscotch-Jelly of course). The black middleman is acted slightly more dramatic than I like, but at least he did not get too much screen time. And the acting is convincing. The drama is kind of cliche but that was pretty much expected from the title.





SCORE:
5
