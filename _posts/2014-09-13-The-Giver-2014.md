untraceable (natural) acting

#COMMENTS:

such stereotypical teen "science" fiction. And it is just plain wrong. Rationality, math, science, techonology are all art. and high art is the only salvation from primal desire (like war etc.) we can ever hope for humanity. Idk don't wanna waste time blabburing about my thoughts here.

also it's just a very uninformed almost propaganda-ish depiction of an autocracy. how can the "elder" sincerely say she's working for the utilitarian good? the whole system is rigged for her special status from the beginning. but then I suppose that's the worst get to the top story again.

also divergence shit.
