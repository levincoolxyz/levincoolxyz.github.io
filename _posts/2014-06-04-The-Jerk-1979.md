#COMMENTS:

the beginning when all the little things that show how navin is so stereotypically white made me lose my shit. most of the rest of the humor are rather dry and try-hard (repetitive) but some is good. the special purpose and a few others are kinda cute. the i don't need one more thing except this get quite phyolosphical though.

I suppose you can interpret a cliche-ish message out of it, but maybe it is just meant to be a comedy.
