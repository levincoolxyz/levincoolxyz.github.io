#COMMENTS:  
  
reasonable entertainment. lucky that I haven't heard of/seen this kind of story in detail before. so many twists that it becomes unsuspenseful  
  
sad to see the crazy "nurse" Millie die.   
  
is he going to try make love to us? :(  
  
can you take your trousers off please?  
	uhh uh it's um it's my shoulder  
please  
		I will do that Millie, you may return to your duties  
but I want to... :(  
  
omg
