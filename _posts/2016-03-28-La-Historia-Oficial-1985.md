be it the junta collaborators like the husband, passive participants like the wife, and the outsiders like the americans, they committed the sin of apathy. it compartmentalizes suffering and justify their personal gains, and to forget whatever transpired would be the natural thing to do (just like what 鲁迅 called out what people did). however, when the desire for truth calls for the wife to rediscover the reality underneath the official villina story, their suffering begins and it shows that it is pointless to lie and hide it for you won't live like a full human. (the husband's continued resistence to these is directly correlated with the angry and stressed life style that he have.) like the grandpa, only living with a clean conscience can gives you peace. But is staying out of the way the best choice for everyone (comparing to the protesters, less disruptions but also less impact)?
