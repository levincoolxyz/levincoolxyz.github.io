#TAGS:  
fresh perspective  
did not get it  
  
fitting soundtrack  
  
unexpected outcome  
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)  
  
untraceable (natural) acting  
  
#COMMENTS:  
  
it is many things, but comedy? no. (ther is no funny moments or plot points, not even black comedy). at best a weird farcical filled with a bunch of marginally horrible person (so not even ironic).  
  
the depiction of life events are rather realistic. but they are pretty bland. and I do not understand the symbolism of "short cuts" maybe that people are acting not as nice/responsible as they should because the other way is easy and a short cut?  
  
and why is there NO explaination why Jerry went crazy for no fucking reason at the end? he acted like a normal person all along...
