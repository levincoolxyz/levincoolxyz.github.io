#TAGS:
fresh perspective
did not get it

fitting soundtrack

unexpected outcome
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)

untraceable (natural) acting

#COMMENTS:

it is many things, but comedy? no. (ther is no funny moments or plot points, not even black comedy). at best a weird farcical filled with a bunch of marginally horrible person (so not even ironic).

the depiction of life events are rather realistic. but they are pretty bland. and I do not understand the symbolism of "short cuts" maybe that people are acting not as nice/responsible as they should because the other way is easy and a short cut?

and why is there NO explaination why Jerry went crazy for no fucking reason at the end? he acted like a normal person all along...
