#COMMENTS:  
  
the fact that it is "improvised" cannot be ignored in its evaluation, however I do feel that if more budget i.e. more planning and shooting happens, it could be even more perfect  
  
love the macro shots and some of the low light shots. gonna go get meself a dslr mark III 8D or whatever it becomes in the future.  
  
not enough actual poetry until the end.
