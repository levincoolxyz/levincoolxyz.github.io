#COMMENTS:

storytelling is (probably intentionally) very chaotic. first half time nothing made sense (other than the revenge plot), then suddenly I guessed everything right and it became no fun. Do not like that they used a physically impossible machine as a crucial plot device. very cheesy and insulting to tesla (btw, tesla looks too healthy). the evil twin was clearly in the wrong in the beginning and then denton just went crazy nuts. Also he's stupid for not even trying to converse with his clone and try it out for a while before doing the killing spree.
