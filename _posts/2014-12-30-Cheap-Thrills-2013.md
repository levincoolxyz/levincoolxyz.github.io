#TAGS:  
silly humor  
stupid  
  
fresh perspective  
this is pointless (either I can't find a point or I disagree whole-heartedly)  
cliché message  
  
immersive atmosphere  
  
expected outcome  
unacceptable suspense (developments predicted too early)  
  
realistic effects  
  
untraceable (natural) acting  
  
#COMMENTS:  
  
extremely predictable for anyone with basic understanding of human nature and game theory. make sense that those two guys fell for the trap the entire way through. I'm they are suppose to be losers of the world and they acted exactly like them.  
points were given only because of there exist acting and it's out of generic formula films
