#COMMENTS:  
  
overall reasonable entertainment, reasonable message (except the woman become the new leader part seems rather like a coup over revolution), but jokes totally spoiled by the trailers. could see why real kim does not appreciate this film. also like the inclusion of actual fucked up stats like usa imprison the most per capita.  
one weird detail, the so-called seal team 6 did not turn the boat around while waiting for extraction team retreiving assets. feels rather unprofessional.  
also did eran got his fingers back or something? it's kinda insignificant though.  
really dig the ending credit sequences. them some good artwork
