#COMMENTS:  
  
story is quite predictable and unbelievable at times (for the right reasons it turns out as the ending shows). one really cool feature was completely swapping out the supporting characters' actors at the very end. it seems to be a lot more stereotypical. also what's with the rapist vibe actions done by the book store owner? was it trying to trick audience's radar to make it slightly more gripping? and she is still a pretty young female not engaging in particularly dangerous occupations so I suspect police would care a bit more about her whereabouts in RL
