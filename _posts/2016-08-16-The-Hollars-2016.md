#COMMENTS:  
  
The story is a romantic comedy with few surprises, but the acting, e.g. the final crying scene with Richard Jenkins was quite moving, especially elevated given all the "fake" cries given before in contrast.  
  
The humor and jokes were on point, and Charlie Day's performance with pretty fitting.  
  
It seems to me that Sharlto was having trouble keeping a straight face particularly in the earlier scenes.
