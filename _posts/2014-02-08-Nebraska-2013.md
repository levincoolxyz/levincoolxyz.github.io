#TAGS:  
empathy and sympathy  
  
fresh perspective  
clich√© message  
  
excellent camera work  
  
unexpected outcome  
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)  
  
untraceable (natural) acting  
#COMMENTS:  
Just a silly story about a silly old man. The vast majority of the story is hard to watch (very boring and quite predictable) but the ending was reasonable and good.
