#COMMENTS:  
  
very moving animation. Cried twice: deer death; ready to hug the missle. The happy ending is not forced at all; logical and heart-warming. Rare deep film (on subject of human nature and power) targeted at children. Gave an optimistic view on human nature obviously (the only cheesy predictable scene when Hoghorth stood in front of the gun. yet it is not too bad because the robot was only killing for vengence when he thought Hoghorth is dead).
