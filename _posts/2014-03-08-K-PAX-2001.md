some characters lacking development

untraceable (natural) acting

#COMMENTS:
The initial cop scene is a rather brash introduction. The police's action seems not well justified.
The fact that he left the notebook behind is not terribly consistent and very intriguing.

the producers/directors/writers of the film clearly want us to believe that prot is real and alien.

It was an entertaining movie for something of a cliche theme of promoting non-violence and peace.

At one point I thought that the guy who got three tasks was robert.

The other patients are not really well developed esp. towards the end. The party scene seems like such a farcical.

Appreciated that there is not much room for scrutiny on the science part.
