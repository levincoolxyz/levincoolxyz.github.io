#COMMENTS:  
  
very funny, great sound design (e.g. the carhorn when pearl fainted) and music, plus the very clever usage of repeating/parallel dialogues perfectly demonstrating the disconnected-ness of different people's state of minds.  
  
the story and characters are quite believable and very relatable, the plot development is simple yet effective.  
  
I suppose the constant fear of nuclear disaster confined the film to its era (not that we don't have this threat nowadays, but that most people would not be worrying about that specifically), but an enduring fear of mortality will stand for times to come.  
  
the story showcases a good dichotomy between faith and truth, how things that easily seemed to be devoid of subjectivity are mostly just beliefs. we have the cause for josh's imprisonment, the constant making and breaking of silly/social contracts ("deals" and "understanding") among the characters...
