#COMMENTS:  
quotes: beautiful things don't ask for attention  
throughout the film, the plot builds up this feeling of how you have to go out there and do the most epic things you ever thought of to really live your life, yet the ending (actual cover photo) reveals how the everyday hard work is (also) what really makes the difference.  
I well expected Walter Mitty himself to be the subject of the cover photo at least since he discovered that the photographer has pictured his mother's piano, however I did not expect the way it was portrayed exactly.
