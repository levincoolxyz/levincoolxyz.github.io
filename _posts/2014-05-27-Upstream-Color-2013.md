#COMMENTS:  
  
Well the 铺垫(forshadowing?) is really extensive and long. the first 25 mins are equal part boring and intriguing, hence was not able to finish watching this in one setting. The ending is strangely fulfilling and many cheesy life metaphors can be made (everyone's finally taking care of their own pig~life~tragedy now), but I am just not really into these kind of stuff (my impression is that if you leave vague and artsy shit around, you are just leaving room for people to waste their time to overthink and try to understand what you mean while you don't even know what you wanted).  
  
the cinematography is very good but no where near mind-blowing. If the artistic and beautiful aspect of the film is striped, the film would be just a scramble mumble jumble of weird shits.  
  
the sound samples are pretty ok.  
  
the plot starts to make sense after about 50 mins for the first watching. The general idea seems to be about struggles of people who suffered from similar tragedies binding together and finding "justice" and ways of overcoming.
