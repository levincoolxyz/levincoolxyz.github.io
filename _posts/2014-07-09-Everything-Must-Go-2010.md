#COMMENTS:  
  
indirectly recommended by Prof. Lesser. The story has a slight but ineffably persistent deepness, yet the storyline is so very simple. Nick's alcoholism is so stupid yet understandable at the same time. good acting and rendition all around, got to read the original short story sometime. plot developements were pretty predictable. And the act of selling/giving away stuff really touched me as I'm moving out (really the first time in my life with a good amount of possession by myself). Stuff really don't matter do they? the important thing is memory, and goodness you do to others.
