#COMMENTS:  
The world building took a while (~1hr), but generally worth the wait.  
Excellent insect inspired flying machines. Although the balloon inflating physics was quite lacking.  
  
Totally unexpected that fluent Chinese made an appearance. However, erring on the side of being butthurt and pc, of course the only such character is the silent, scheming, smart, but backstabbing traitor. sigh.
