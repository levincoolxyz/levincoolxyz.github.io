#COMMENTS:  
  
surprised that there actually is an interesting underlying theme that worked well with the classic jackie chan style. good comedy and drama all round.  
  
峰峦如聚，  
波涛如怒，  
山河表里潼关路。  
望西都，  
意踌躇。  
伤心秦汉经行处，  
宫阙万间都做了土。  
兴，百姓苦；亡，百姓苦。  
  
nitpicking: accents are bit weird, and the canoe came out of nowhere.
