#COMMENTS:  
  
This is a decent example of (science) fiction movie done right IMO - the aim is to explore a fictional premise, improbable in the real world, and how it would unfold should it actually happened in the real world. minus the lack of cinematographic values and at times the cringe worthy one-liners with generic romcom developments and ending, it would be a master piece of its kind. Even with these less than exceptional traits, it is still a solid entertainment piece.
