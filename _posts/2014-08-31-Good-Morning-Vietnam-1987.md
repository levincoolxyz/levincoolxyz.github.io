#COMMENTS:

this is probably the most lachrymose comedy I've ever seen yet. every single time when robin williams make a good joke (especially the scene when he met the soldiers on the street) the unnamable sorrow covers my head. we constantly use such method to motivate people into "happy" killing machines. The look of those young faces stepping into bloodshed and hatred for nothing worthy with those laughter is just heartbreaking. same goes for those vietnamese students of English. And it is just simply depressing how powerless we are as a society on satisfying the very simple needs of everyone without conflicts.
