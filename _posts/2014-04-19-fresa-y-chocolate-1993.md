#COMMENTS:  
  
The beginning of the film was rather cliche and cheesy, but it took a good and deep turn after that.  
  
Vivian is such a bitch from the get go, the lack of portrayal of her emotional struggle make her extremely shallow and unlovable, which in turn undermines the integrity of Davi since then the only plausible reason for their love is superfulously related to a pretty face.  
  
Diego is such a wonderful person with a tragic life. His encounters deeply saddens me. Of course I blame it partially on his lack of interests in mathematics. Once you go there, no one can stop you and you can keep living even if you lose all hope in corpreal humanity.  
  
Watching the transformation of Davi reminded me my personal transformation related to the CCP.
