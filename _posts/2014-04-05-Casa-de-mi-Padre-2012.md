#COMMENTS:  
Slightly above my expectation. Many classic Will Ferrel type (not funny) jokes. Few but very hilarious scene. Esp. the part when they both turned there faces as soon as one character tries to look at another. Good mockery, and weirdly have an positive (though not very special yet not quite cliche) message of "not every ... is a ...".
