#COMMENTS:  
  
I did not expect to like this given the synopsis in the SXSW package, but I enjoyed it. Thanks Michael.  
  
From literal ones to the giant black erect IKEA shelves, this film showcased a great imagined scenario demonstrating all sort of dick measuring contests people (myself included) do.  
  
"I have a beautiful erection, do you want me to fuck you?"  
  
In the end it's awesome that the winner of the specific contest is not specified, yet the "cabin boy" is still trying to up his game by telling ridiculous stories and insulting his superiors. the game goes on.  
  
One might think this comparison is pointless since life sort of is. But as long as no one gets harmed (unlike the real world), it can make living fun.
