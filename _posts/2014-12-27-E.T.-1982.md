#COMMENTS:  
  
heart warming classic with a bit much of unnecessary bike riding.  
  
I liked the intentially misleading portrayal of the NASA lead, but why does the kid felt it was necessary to trick him in the end? he seems nice enough to not let people disect E.T. should he realize that he's alive and need to go home.  
  
what's the point for the other gang of kids in the end?  
  
why was E.T. dying? b/c he's away from mama for too long?
