#COMMENTS:  
  
as good as romcom gets. pretty funny, kinda unpredictable and predictable developments at the same time, and it's a story worth hearing. sweet ending that is realistic  
  
btw, the trailer was really full of dead give away on jokes and counterproductive. luckily I did not see that first.
