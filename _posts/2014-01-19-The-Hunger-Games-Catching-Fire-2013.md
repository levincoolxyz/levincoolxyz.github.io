#COMMENTS:  
  
The Hunger Games leadership (president snow) is, in my humble opinion, violating the three key principle of a stable authoritarian regime. (False) sensation of equality (不患寡而患不均，不患贫而患不安，不患贫而患不公), Religious belief of god given authority, and utilisation of everyone's minimal yet tangible hope for life/peace/happiness (侥幸心理) are what I believe to be the pillars of repression.  
  
specific to the movie, this guy (Andy Gavin) said it all:  
The very end felt extremely abrupt.  
If President Snow obliterated district 12, where’s his coal coming from?  
Catniss’ electric arrow trick? Common! Everyone knows that electricity travels at the speed of light. You can’t shoot an arrow AFTER the lightning bolt hits and then watch the electricity move down the wire.[Also while the normal path of the electricity goes directly from fake sky to tree to ground, the path with the arrow just parralleled a small bit of the tree (excellent conductor according to the film) with very thin copper wire and the metalic part of the dome... that not going to have much current)  
You also can’t shoot an arrow with a fire hundreds of yards into the sky.  
Catniss' quiver refills magically.  
How could the conspirator’s plan depend on her shooting out the dome?
