#COMMENTS:
This was a beautiful story. It was actually quite moving. To see a bigoted person change is a great process. However, as the second comment pointed out, since the transgender character is fictitious, I'd like to say that a person of great passion and compassion to start a "buyer's club" for terminal patients are most likely not a bigoted person to begin with. But it is possible since a death notification always provided the strongest self-reflections.

Too bad that the transgender character does not have a factual basis. But I suppose this also means that the script writers actually have some talent in creating stories (unlike "the wolf of wall street" which just composes of good acting on an existing (unverifiable) crazy story).
