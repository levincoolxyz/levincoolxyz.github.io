#COMMENTS:

well after watching this, Fruitvale station's copying in plot arrangement is quite evident. but that film lacks the philosophical depth and growth La Haine touched on. the struggle here is less everyday but more intense and mentally stressing.

Fruitvale could well be a fictional prequel to La Haine - i.e. Abdel could be oscar grant

the expression of the new cop during the torture scene shows exactly the same struggle 鲁迅 pointed out. forget to live with your own inaction and inability, remember to be responsible and fight back. on the one hand you know it's wrong and uneasy and disgusting, on the other what should/could you do? ultimately one person cannot change the whole world instantly. the struggle has to be slow and long and sad.

the russian guy's bathroom story is quite intriguing. from what I gathered it is essentially 鱼与熊掌不可兼得 with a twist that here the surviving solution requires some form of shameless and the train of life never waits for you specifically. some random guy on internet said that this also implies a change in attitude (stop being "shy" when taking a dump on the way to the fucking siberian labor camp [wait is that a metaphor saying life is just going straight to hell]) is required to "fix" the social problems they face. I suppose in a sense racism is a form of pride combined with lazyness - you want to be superior without doing extra. I suppose it presents a dilenma for the minorities that for them "pride ([asking for] equality)" and "success (out of the projects/getto, financial/social/safety gain)" don't come together.
