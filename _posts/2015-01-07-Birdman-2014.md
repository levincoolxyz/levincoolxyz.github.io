#COMMENTS:  
  
This picture is awesome even just for its technical achievements. Really sells the omnipotent 3rd person viewpoint. Although some times it is self-evident where takes were cut, the transitions are pretty excellent in general.  
  
But this really should not be put in the comedy genre... humorous maybe, satirical yes, but a tragedy it is (other than its title for taking a shot at batman)  
  
The only less than satisfactory part was the ending. It gives such a sense of unfulfilled-ness and uncertainty that really make this film more of a 衰世之说 (descriptive not prescriptive). However that is not to say that I know of a way to make it better, as it does help the film in presenting the theme that the desire to transcend beyond corporeal existence drive us into a superficial struggle destined for many disappointments.  
  
And I believe that anyone unable to appreciate this message have probably yet to experience their identity crisis.  
  
####Quotes:  
  
what did you want? To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the earth.  
  
Is this real, or are you shooting a film? You people are full of Shit!
