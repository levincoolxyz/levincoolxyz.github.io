kids are such weak-minded little twats. 敬酒不吃吃罚酒 欺软怕硬 好话不听 （sorry）  
  
wait the horse is sad and sunk, but then you are sad why don't you sink? nonsense  
  
Morla, the ancient one. a.k.a. the oldest fart in the whole west. (sorry again)  
  
wow what a nice tree. did your gardener trimmed it like that?  
  
I like children... could you come scratch me here... I can never seems to touch it myself... (thrice the sorry)  
  
I need a banana for scale... how is the cup normal size for the giant kid yet the tiny old elf couple can lift them with such ease? are you all powerlifting champaigns?  
  
nipples! (sorry yet another time)
