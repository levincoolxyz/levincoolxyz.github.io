#COMMENTS:

Very peculiar film. The tourist "Bob" is a great character. A little off-beat, somewhat poetic (游吟诗人), smart yet stubborn. Jack and Zack are pretty good depiction of small-time criminal and good-hearted "idiot".

Most of the film is rather enjoyable, with some drawn out scenes (though I can see why it was shot like that, I get bored easily as the cinematography is not out of the world impressive as in "il conformista").

The jokes are very subtle.
