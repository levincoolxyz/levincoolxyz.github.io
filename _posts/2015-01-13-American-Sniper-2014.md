#COMMENTS:  
  
there are not just 3 types of people, but rather there are 2 sides of 2 types of confrontational action: aggression vs. submission, rational vs. irrational.  
  
no need to repeat footage. I got memory.  
  
just seeing his humanity being stripped away bit by bit. 陷入深渊不能自拔  
  
sadly we may never know the (true) story on the other side, but I refuse to believe that the enemy sniper is such a one-dimensional person for his skill.  
  
what's with the bullshit on jesse ventura... who would keep suing for deformation after the party is murdered... does monetary compensation mean that much to you?  
  
the movie is a bit premature as far as the ending goes since we don't really know what had happened during the murder. I suppose this is one downside of adapting a RL story. (It really is very incomprehensible for a veteran to murder a successful, protective, helping felow veteran. That is some level of PTSD.)  
  
also it seems that the real chris is a bit more bloodthirsty (giving no fuck to the Iraqis etc.) and less shaken.  
  
Why is it that soldiers get gunshots on their funeral? seems like the biggest irony of all time.
