#COMMENTS:  
  
The songs are great. However, unlike the music videos, makeups, and costumes, which clearly shows potential but lack some polishing, the music is too awesome to the point that it kind of broke the suspension of disbelief for me. (as in they could totally be famous for producing those songs IRL.)  
  
I missed the reason why didn't the big bro go play the solo at the "prom"  
  
So I suppose the message is to go live dangerously?
