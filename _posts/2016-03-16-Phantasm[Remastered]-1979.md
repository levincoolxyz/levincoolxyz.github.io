#TAGS:  
  
fresh perspective  
  
immersive atmosphere  
beautiful scenes  
  
intricate storyline (what the fuck just happened? have to read elsewhere or re-watch)  
some characters lacking development  
  
#COMMENTS:  
  
many nice compositions and lightings in scenes. e.g. the flipped over ice cream jeep/truck scene.  
  
weird, cranky acting, though still above average given its budget and casting and era. the ending twist is a bit strong like a bad cliffhanger, however. I suppose only one scenario can be true? Maybe I will watch the sequels eventually.  
  
JJ Abrams / Bad robot did a great job on restoring the film.
