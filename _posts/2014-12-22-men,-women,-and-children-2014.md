#COMMENTS:

I say that is merely a good film, but an important film. so a low 8 rating on my imdb scale.
overall the experience of the kids is like a dramatized version of my upbringing. being transitioned from china to here at high school kind of made me a witness of all these changes and perfectly share contrary views held by the parents and kids in this film at the same time.
the narration is annoying and mostly unnecessary as usual.
horrible psychologist/consellor. hopefully the real ones are not that shitty. treating it like a job and a job only. I think this is a result of specialization. as people push these important emotional tasks out to the "professionals" a very important touch is lost.
The giving up footballer have some of the similar (exactly the same) experience that I had, but 
the porn addicted cannot rise guy is a bit extreme
the plot with the giving up footballer and overprotected girl is done at an appropriate degree (resonance), everything else very much so overdramatized.
btw, carl sagon is like one of the asshole you know that?
whoever attacked this film for it's not portraying the goodness done by socalled social media are very much so blindsided. would you expect a book on middle eastern conflict talk about the good practice qoran or bible suggests?
