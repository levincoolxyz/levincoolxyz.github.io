It should have stopped at 2:40 and I would have really enjoyed it.  
  
But no. You have to keep developing a character that (I think) unlikely to exist in real life and is utterly dense. Following a suspected Kinder Entf√ºhrer is very logical, coming out to scout out the house without dialing 911? a bit stupid. Choosing to just walk up and start shooting people? You should've commited suicide earlier. I was found yelling at the screen when he started to sneak around that in his position the only correct things to do is either directly confront them about what is going on, or wait for police to arrive and investigate, or if you are afraid for the child's safety, confront them with a gun. without firing them.
