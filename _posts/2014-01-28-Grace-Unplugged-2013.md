#COMMENTS:  
The early part of the film is a prime example of the failure of "church" and "religion" and bad parenting. The father only provides his point of view to grace but never explain his reason and/or experiences. He presents no argument, yet wish other to comply. I'm not even sure there is one. Not to say that I disagree on encouraging Grace go to college instead of go to LA and do shit music, but I would give reasons (good ones if I'm him esp. since he had first-hand experience (like you can only make it on your own if you got publicity and are truly talented))  
"...but if you still want to do it pleasing God..." like God would give a shit about your (or my) pathetic being  
"...she had the best teacher..." Now this is just a grossly inaccurate statement  
"...I'think you are fighting god..." NOPE. TOO MUCH I'm not going to waste anymore of my life on this shit
