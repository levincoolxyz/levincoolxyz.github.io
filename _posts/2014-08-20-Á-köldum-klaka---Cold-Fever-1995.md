#COMMENTS:  
  
very strange film on a "very strange country"  
  
even with the psychic connection, random screaming but helping spirit, and all the other charades right in your face, the tale strikes not as made-up but mythical and spiritual. Hirata's journey is surly an interesting one. It feels pointless to make out a message but I guess one needs to do things for the loved ones and step outside of comfort zone and be brave would be the most secular one?  
  
that murderous american couple reminds me of pulp fiction, possibly with more bloodthrust. (I mean the girl probably would not insist on needing the money if he just shows the gun) but I suppose she might not be killed as the guy was running out instead of calming walking out. yet shots fired so idk
