#COMMENTS:  
  
So I think that the point of the movie is that the main character recovered from his deep depression caused by the tragic loss of his wife through the connection with the survivaling (and growth/acceptence of) family of his friend. The two window smashing thing was quite original/abrupt and phenomenal, and a bit funny as well to be honest. what I do not get is the beginning scene when he ignored the woman calling for help on the side of the road... what that meant to express his strong detachment and voluntary occlusion from the society or were they imaginary events from his hallucinations? Overall the movie is sweet and the reasonable, but nothing too deep happened.
