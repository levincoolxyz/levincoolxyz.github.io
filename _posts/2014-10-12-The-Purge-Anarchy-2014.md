#TAGS:  
stupid  
  
this is pointless (either I can't find a point or I disagree whole-heartedly)  
  
expected outcome  
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)  
  
intense action  
realistic effects  
  
#COMMENTS:  
  
pretty stupid. i suppose one could see this as a guilty pleasure of sorts.  
  
people who would kill would be very unlikely to stop as the siren sounds.  
  
people who are not fanatics are less capable of becoming rich in a "free" society. so unless you need to be radical to get paid (not just get elected), those crazy policies are not going to be the mainstream. the closest US got was the red scares etc. but that was nothing like open murder.  
  
if I can kill anyone without any kind of punishment (i guess physically speaking to others, but retroactively, it is punishing to myself) I'll probably just end my own life.
