#TAGS:  
silly humor  
  
empathy and sympathy  
  
fresh perspective  
layered meaning (good for over-thinking/multiple viewing)  
  
immersive atmosphere  
  
expected outcome  
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)  
untraceable (natural) acting  
noticeable acting  
  
#COMMENTS:  
  
lots of the "real footage" seemed not too genuine.  
  
kinda sort've seen it coming. the twist is a bit cliche but nicely done (almost got tears in me eye, reminded me of Up, as every other such couple sequences do nowadays).  
  
good points/message on people are only capable of seeing what they want to see.
