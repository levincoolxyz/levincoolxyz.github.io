#COMMENTS:  
  
same pitfall of gore/horror genre films, all parties are villianized so much so that there is no identification/empathy or sympathy possible => not really scary.  
  
but fun twists as a thrilling entertainment  
  
doesn't explain why the hell the rich family couldn't figure out where their daughter went.  
  
also the "i don't rape but here's a syringe of my semen" just makes me think he's impotent. just like the hammer used in Chugyeogja (the chaser). Maybe that is the makers' intention.
