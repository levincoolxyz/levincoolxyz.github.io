#TAGS:
silly humor

fresh perspective
did not get it

immersive atmosphere

acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)

untraceable (natural) acting

#COMMENTS:
There are occational humor, but mostly full of drudge (dull it's what I mean) and mandane melancoly. The story is not too engaging, and the characters' outcome seems well justifies by their actions (what else would you expect with that career choice and personal outlook?) Don't really get it.





SCORE:
