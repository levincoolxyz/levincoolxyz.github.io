#TAGS:  
silly humor  
  
fresh perspective  
did not get it  
  
immersive atmosphere  
  
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)  
  
untraceable (natural) acting  
  
#COMMENTS:  
There are occational humor, but mostly full of drudge (dull it's what I mean) and mandane melancoly. The story is not too engaging, and the characters' outcome seems well justifies by their actions (what else would you expect with that career choice and personal outlook?) Don't really get it.
