#TAGS:
silly humor

clich√© message

immersive atmosphere

expected outcome
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)

intense action
realistic effects
epic effects

untraceable (natural) acting

#COMMENTS:

feel good bullshit action flick. would've been more entertaining if everything were equalized by song and dance
also home alone at the home depot. with too many closed and open doors (too obvious/cheap way of portraying conflict)





SCORE:
7
