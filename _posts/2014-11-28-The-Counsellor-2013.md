this is pointless (either I can't find a point or I disagree whole-heartedly)  
cliché message  
  
immersive atmosphere  
beautiful scenes  
  
expected outcome  
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)  
exceptional suspense (developments not predicted)  
  
intense action  
realistic effects  
  
untraceable (natural) acting  
  
#COMMENTS:  
  
it just felt a bit pretentious. and everything seems to be driven by the monetary greed and that is it. Everybody acted "predictably" based on their different level of greed and ability/power. and the inability to see true value independent of money. (the fact that the counsellor felt the need to buy a "rare" diamond etc.)
