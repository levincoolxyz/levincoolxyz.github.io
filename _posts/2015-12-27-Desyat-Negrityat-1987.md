#COMMENTS:  
  
not as high of production values comparing to its more modern cousins, (except the actresses are all very nice looking but not absurdly so unfit for their role), but the lack of PC compromises was right on.  
  
the dialog acting and set design as well as people placement does feel a bit dated, but they still work for the job.  
  
just gotta appreciate how waking up from a nightmare is portrayed in the film (1:11). at least from my personal experiences, I cannot recall any waking up moments that are as clear as cliche sudden yells and instant clarity. waking up is most always induced by external stimuli (except when the sleep goes on for too long >12hrs) regardless of the horror or weirdness of the dream, but more importantly it always takes quite a few moments for me to grasp which "reality" is real. kudos to the actor and editor and director.  
  
1:13 I guess Ms. Brent is a true bible thumper  
  
tbh that tantrum was believable, but how can you slap? and she calm down quicker than I can type /s   
  
the guilt trip for the young teacher is a bit too strong in the sense that the film did not do a perfect job of explaining how the general's talk way back influenced her thinking of death as a relief. (although the craziness of the "mysterious" rope and chair plus the "forced" murder that you might say rooted in that rape does work pretty well.)  
  
the judge's soliloquies kinda of ruined the atmosphere. It probably is necessary for the book to tie up all loose ends, but for a film adaptation, I think showing just the judge's action provides good enough explanations with added power due to pithiness.
