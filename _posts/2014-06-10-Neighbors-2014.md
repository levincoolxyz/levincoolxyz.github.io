silly humor  
discremenating humor  
physical comedy  
  
fresh perspective  
clich√© message  
  
expected outcome  
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)  
  
untraceable (natural) acting  
  
#COMMENTS:  
  
irresponsible/unrealistic cop behavior at its prime  
  
the ball throw and air bag is most definitely assault (i complain cuz they are not funny)  
  
why the hell would they tell the bullied kid the previous actions that took place  
  
after a cop gone rougue and shot in the sky i'm pretty sure ppl won't go back just for the lights back off/on  
  
and why is the beta not pronouced so often? I must be missing something
