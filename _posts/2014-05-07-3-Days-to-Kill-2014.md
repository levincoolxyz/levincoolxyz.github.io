#TAGS:  
silly humor  
  
this is pointless (either I can't find a point or I disagree whole-heartedly)  
  
immersive atmosphere  
  
expected outcome  
acceptable suspense (developments predicted minutes before)  
  
intense action  
  
untraceable (natural) acting  
  
#COMMENTS:  
  
very generic action film. had 1 laugh. plots are a bit convoluted and unrealistic as usual. characters are weird and jumpy emotionally. some cuts are very abrupt. reasonable actions.
