	<h1>Current Activities</h1>
	<p>This page is as much of a personal reminder as a status update...... Also see <a href="/todo.html">a list of concepts to be tackled</a>.</p>
	<p><em>Updated 12/29/2015</em></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Serious Math</h2>
	<h4>Goal: more topology!</h4>
	<p>still not done with May's super concise course</p>
	<p>still at chapter 2 of Adam's infinite loop spaces</p>
	<p>intermittently reading LS Category, Characteristic Classes, Cohomology Operations, the Wild World of 4 Manifolds, K-theory ...</p>

	<h4>Goal: get a more systematic understanding of Discrete Differential Geometry</h4>
	<p>finished reading Keenan's DDG notes, still yet to code something in it</p>
	<p>started working through Bobenko & Suris' DDG book. Nets!</p>

	<h4>Goal: relearn foundational Algebraic geometry</h4>
	<p>about to work through Shafarevich again now equipped with more topology and intuitions...</p>
	<p>same deal as above but for Hartshorne and Vakil's notes...</p>
	<p>started bits and pieces (mostly the chapter about Gröbner basis) of Eisenbud's Comm. Alg.</p>

	<h4>Goal: review class notes</h4>
	<p>readings and notes from Freed's K theory class, understand Clifford algebra and rep theory better</p>
	<p>notes from Gompf's 4-mfd class and his book, understand Kirby calculus better, maybe complement this with Akbulut's 4-mfd lecture notes</p>
	<p>notes from Gunningham's D-module class and references</p>
	<p>notes from Blumberg's Homotopy type theory from wayyy back</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Work related</h2>
	<h4>Goal: conclude my work on dynamical effects of ACC and CG misalignment knowledge based on GRACE data</h4>
	<p>finish write ups in AIAA's "Technical Note" specs. still aiming for publication</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Math for Fun</h2>		
	<h4>Goal: get more detailed sense of Atiyah-Singer Index theorem</h4>
	<p>started reading Daniel's undergrad honor thesis</p>

	<h4>Goal: understand the historical context and motivation of ...</h4>
	<p>started skimming through Hawkin's Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups</p>
	<p>reading the point of pointless topology</p>

	<h4>Goal: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h4>
	<p>go through all the newly free springer books and find what I like... now it's 15 and counting. so excited</p>
	<p>still reading the "What is" columns and more of the Princeton Companion <em>slowly</em>...</p>
	<p>figure out how to work genus 2 Dehn twists to beat Teruaki</p>
	<p>try to rigorously explain when are repetitions of simple K'nex angle joints planar</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Other</h2>
	<h4>Goal: explore alternatives</h4>
	<p>trying to read an old book about time series prediction and complexity issues per Dr. Bettadpur's suggestion</p>
	<p>working on the stuff that the Google recruiter suggested to prepare for their interview, maybe through a MOOC</p>

	<h4>Goal: guitar</h4>
	<p>those nylon strings are finally more or less set</p>
	<p>Perfect the playing of "Romance" (cf. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5tEd16aBCY">this performance</a>) and the link to the classic bullfighter theme (España Cañí).</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">still some GRAD SCHOOL APPS left</h2>
