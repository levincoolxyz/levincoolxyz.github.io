	<h1>Current Activities</h1>
	<p>This page is as much of a status update as a personal agenda/reminder......</p>
	<p><em>Updated 1/23/2016</em></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Work</h2>
	<p>BACK2SCHOOL: will try to tag along <a href="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/neitzke/teaching/392C-higgs-bundles/">Prof.Neitzke's Higgs Bundle</a>, <a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/benzvi/teaching/alggeom/syllabus.html">Prof.BenZvi's AG</a>, Prof.Allcock's Kac-Moody algebra, and <a href="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/perutz/RiemannSurfaces.html">Prof.Perutz's Riemann Surfaces</a> classes.</p>
	<p>finish write ups on dynamical effects of ACC and CG misalignment knowledge based on GRACE data, in AIAA's "Technical Note" specification.</p>
	<p>preparing for Google's SWE interview, probably through some MOOC on algorithms and the Programming Pearls</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Readings</h2>
	<h4>Topology!</h4>
	<p>never gonna give May's super concise course up</p>
	<p>still around chapter 2 of Adam's infinite loop spaces</p>
	<p>intermittently reading LS Category, Milnor's Characteristic Classes, Cohomology Operations, the Wild World of 4 Manifolds, Algebraic Operads ...</p>

	<h4>discrete/combinatorial/computational Geometry</h4>
	<p>learn/think/read more about thin-sheet and buckling mechanics...</p>
	<p>finished reading Keenan's Discrete Differential Geometry notes, yet to code things in it</p>
	<p>started working through Bobenko & Suris' DDG book. Nets!</p>
	<p>gotta read papers!</p>
	<p>keep on reading Using the Borsuk-Ulam theorem</p>

	<h4>Algebraic Geometry</h4>
	<p>about to work through Shafarevich again now equipped with more topology and intuitions...</p>
	<p>same deal as above but for Hartshorne and Vakil's notes...</p>
	<p>started bits and pieces (mostly the chapter about Gröbner basis) of Eisenbud's Comm. Alg.</p>
	<p>picking up Viosin's Hodge theory book again</p>

	<h4>Other</h4>
	<p>started some noncommutative geometry notes online</p>
	<p>reading Daniel Chupin's undergrad thesis on heat kernel proof of the AS index theorem</p>
	<p>continue Lieb & Seiringer's stability of matter in QM</p>
	<p>review readings and notes from Freed's K-theory class, particularly the parts about Clifford algebra and rep/Lie theory. also Atiyah's K-theory</p>
	<p>review notes from Gompf's 4-mfd class and his book, complementing with Akbulut's lecture notes, aiming to get Kirby calculus down better</p>
	<p>review notes and references from Gunningham's D-module class</p>
	<p>same for Blumberg's Homotopy type theory class from wayyy back, maybe catch up some recent results</p>
	<p>started skimming through Hawkin's Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups</p>
	<p>get the point of pointless topology</p>
	<p>keep on slogging thru the "What is" columns compilation and the Princeton Companion...</p>

	<p>Also see <a href="/todo.html">a list of concepts to be tackled.</a></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2>
	<p>figure out how to work genus 2 Dehn twists to beat Teruaki</p>
	<p>try to rigorously explain when are repetitions of simple K'nex angle joints planar</p>
	<p>Perfect the playing of "Romance" (cf. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5tEd16aBCY">this performance</a>) and the link to the classic bullfighter theme (España Cañí).</p>
	<p>Learn how to play Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, and Radiohead's Street Spirit on Guitar.</p>
	<p>restart regular piano practices</p>
	<p>training for a 5K (Rock n' Roll "marathon" in Dallas) on March 18</p>
	<p>organizing. photos, the photography page, about metal earth models, all the tabs I saved and still open on my phone...</p>
	<p>started hoarding facts from past Ig-noble prizes. <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/282526/3/MO_1007.pdf">this</a> one is my favorite yet. I wonder how does hunger factor into decision making. I image it would stop inhibitors on impulsive actions?</p>
	<p>so. many. movies. to watch</p>
