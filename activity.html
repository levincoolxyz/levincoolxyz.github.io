	<h1>Current Activities</h1>
	<p>This page is as much of a status update as a personal agenda/reminder......</p>
	<p><em>Updated 01/17/2017</em></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Research</h2>
	<p>I now belongs to the plain and simple breed of RA for <a href="kanso.usc.edu">Prof. Kanso</a>. We are on our way to model flagella/cilia ensembles at the moment (1D active filaments in fluids).</p>
	<p>Supervised by/joint with <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/evouga/">Prof. Etienne Vouga</a> and <a href="http://keenan.is/here">Prof. Keenan Crane</a>, the discrete inverse spectral problem on closed g=0 surfaces. We now have some preliminary results for both simplicial meshes and "mesh-free" representations in spherical harmonic basis. I need to summarize my findings. I have a public project page <a href="/invspec">here</a>.</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Readings</h2>
	<p>Audoly, Pomeau's Elasticity and Geometry. many discrete 1D/2D elastic models use this as the continuous model reference.</p>
	<p>various biolocomotion dynamics papers, classic to current</p>

	<h4>For Leisure (e.g. pure math)</h4>
	<p>This nice note I found by Étienne Ghys (A Singular Mathematical Promenade) that starts from a cool proof of Konsevich and goes on to most everything I knew/heard about pure math.</p>
	<p>the Harvard notes Prof. Fokas kindly sent to me about the more "mathematical" backgrounds of his general PDE BVP analytic AND computational methods. Still flabergasted by "there's no inherent discrete spectra."</p>
	<p>Riemann Zeta Function by Edwards</p>
	<p>probably will pause May's super concise course for now</p>
	<p>VERY intermittently on Adam's infinite loop spaces, Bott and Tu's forms in AT, Milnor's char classes and morse theory, cohomology operations, algebraic operads, the wild world of 4 mflds ...</p>
	<p>a wish to retain BenZvi's 'basket' as long as possible by revisiting notes/Vakil/Shafarevich/Hartshorne...</p>
	<p>bits and pieces (mostly the chapter about Gröbner basis) of Eisenbud's Comm. Alg.</p>
	<p>sheaf cohomology in topological signal processing </p>
	<p>noncommutative geometry</p>
	<p>Daniel Chupin's heat kernel AS index thesis</p>
	<p>K-theory: Freed's class note and Antiyah's book and Quillen's side of the story</p>
	<p>I really want to get to know 4-mflds better. Gompf's book, notes, and that of Akbulut's. Kirby calculus will be conquered (before I die)</p>
	<p>get the point of pointless topology</p>
	<p>Lieb & Seiringer's stability of matter in QM</p>
	<p>"What is" columns and the Princeton Companion are now officially my bedtime stories...</p>

	<p>Also see <a href="/todo.html">a list of concepts to be tackled.</a></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2>
	<p>am sticking to DTLAW for olympic lifts. last sunday's new C&J PR of 67kg (BW~69kg) had me a cold "relapse" D:</p>
	<p>try to rigorously explain when are repetitions of simple K'nex angle joints planar</p>
	<p>Still no pianos but have guitar back. Chords Delilah Rising sun ...... many "etudes" to conquer</p>
	<p>A very long IMDb watch list (now it's 530+ ) and significant TV show addictions that I am planning to "cure"</p>
