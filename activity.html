	<h1>Current Activities</h1>
	<p>This page is as much of a status update as a personal agenda/reminder......</p>
	<p><em>Updated 08/12/2016</em></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Work/Research</h2>
	<p>The next stage for the discrete 2d inverse spectral problem for/with <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/evouga/">Prof. Etienne Vouga</a> and <a href="http://keenan.is/here">Prof. Keenan Crane</a>. We have some positive preliminary results for simplicial meshes and now we are working on doing things "mesh-free" in spherical harmonic basis. Checkout the project page <a href="/invspec">here</a>.</p>
	<p>School's starting next week. I suppose lots of basic maths/physics review this semester... I thought I escaped having to take GRE math again :P</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Readings (I hope USC library has a good selection)</h2>
	<h4>Dynamics/Control/(bio)locomotion/Motion planning</h4>
	<p>Waiting for directives, still exploring some literature</p>

	<h4>For Leisure (so pure math)</h4>
	<p>Riemann Zeta Function by Edwards</p>
	<p>maybe will have to give May's super concise course up eventually</p>
	<p>still within chapter 2 of Adam's infinite loop spaces</p>
	<p>and of course still intermittently on Bott and Tu's forms in AT, Milnor's char classes and morse theory, cohomology operations, algebraic operads, the wild world of 4 mflds ...</p>
	<p>will revisit UT summer AG seminar/Vakil/Shafarevich/Hartshorne if I get free time. Otherwise I will surly waste BenZvi's 'basket'...</p>
	<p>bits and pieces (mostly the chapter about Gröbner basis) of Eisenbud's Comm. Alg.</p>
	<p>Viosin's Hodge theory as well as reviewing some of Higgs Bundle notes</p>
	<p>topological signal processing vs. sheaf cohomology </p>
	<p>noncommutative geometry still?</p>
	<p>Daniel Chupin's heat kernel AS index thesis</p>
	<p>continue Lieb & Seiringer's stability of matter in QM</p>
	<p>K-theory: Freed's class note and Antiyah's book and the Quillen side of the story</p>
	<p>I really want to get to know 4-mflds better. Gompf's book, notes, and that of Akbulut's. Kirby calculus will be conquered</p>
	<p>get the point of pointless topology</p>
	<p>"What is" columns and the Princeton Companion are now officially my bedtime stories...</p>

	<p>Also see <a href="/todo.html">a list of concepts to be tackled.</a></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2>
	<p>Already got clean&jerk down this summer, time to learn snatch. Can't wait to go back to the gym! Also maybe joining the boxing/climbing clubs here.</p>
	<p>try to rigorously explain when are repetitions of simple K'nex angle joints planar</p>
	<p>Musical instruments are on a pause. Need to find used guitar and place to practice piano</p>
	<p>A very long IMDb watch list (now it's 500+ after a summer of MUBI... HOW?!)</p>
