	<h4>Topology!</h4>
	<p>still not done with May's super concise course</p>
	<p>still at chapter 2 of Adam's infinite loop spaces</p>
	<p>intermittently reading LS Category, Characteristic Classes, Cohomology Operations, the Wild World of 4 Manifolds, Algebraic Operads, Atiyah's K-theory ...</p>

	<p>Discrete Differential Geometry</p>
	<p>finished reading Keenan's DDG notes, yet to code things in it</p>
	<p>started working through Bobenko & Suris' DDG book. Nets!</p>

	<h4>AG</h4>
	<p>about to work through Shafarevich again now equipped with more topology and intuitions...</p>
	<p>same deal as above but for Hartshorne and Vakil's notes...</p>
	<p>started bits and pieces (mostly the chapter about Gröbner basis) of Eisenbud's Comm. Alg.</p>
	<p>picking up Viosin's Hodge theory book again</p>

	<h4>Other</h4>
	<p>reading Daniel's undergrad honor thesis on heat kernel proof of the AS Index theorem</p>
	<p>review readings and notes from Dan Freed's K theory class, mostly parts about Clifford algebra and rep/Lie theory</p>
	<p>review notes from Gompf's 4-mfd class and read his book, complementing it with Akbulut's lecture notes, aim to get Kirby calculus down better</p>
	<p>review notes and references from Gunningham's D-module class</p>
	<p>same for Blumberg's Homotopy type theory class from wayyy back, maybe catch up some</p>
	<p>started skimming through Hawkin's Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups</p>
	<p>reading the point of pointless topology</p>
	<p>still reading the "What is" columns and more of the Princeton Companion <em>slowly</em>...</p>

	<p>Also see <a href="/todo.html">a list of concepts to be tackled.</a></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Work</h2>
	<p>almost done with grad school apps now</p>
	<p>finish write ups on dynamical effects of ACC and CG misalignment knowledge based on GRACE data. in AIAA's "Technical Note" specs.</p>
	<p>preparing for Google's swe interview, probably through a MOOC and maybe will buy a book</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2>
	<p>figure out how to work genus 2 Dehn twists to beat Teruaki</p>
	<p>try to rigorously explain when are repetitions of simple K'nex angle joints planar</p>
	<p>Perfect the playing of "Romance" (cf. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5tEd16aBCY">this performance</a>) and the link to the classic bullfighter theme (España Cañí).</p>
	<p>restart regular piano practices</p>
	<p>training for a 5K in March</p>
