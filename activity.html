	<h1>Current Activities</h1>
	<p>This page is as much of a personal motivation/reminder as a summary page of my interests...</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Serious Math</h2>
	<h4>Goal: more (algebraic) topology<h4>
	<p>still reading May</p>
	<p>started reading Adam's book about infinite loop spaces</p>
	<p>reading Milnor and Stasheff's classic Characteristic Classes, etc. etc.</p>

	<h4>Goal: get a more systematic understanding of Discrete Differential Geometry<h4>
	<p>try finish reading Keenan's DEC notes</p>
	<p>started working through Bobenko & Suris' DDG book</p>

	<h4>Goal: Relearn foundational Algebraic geometry<h4>
	<p>Time to reread Hartshorne now that I have more examples and fundamentals down...</p>
	<p>started bits and pieces (mostly the chapter about Grobner basis) of Eisenbud's Comm. Alg.</p>

	<h4>Goal: Review past notes<h4>
	<p>notes from Gompf's 4-mfd class and his book, figure out</p>
	<p>notes from Gunningham's D-module class and references</p>
	<p>notes from Blumberg's Homotopy type theory wayyy back</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Work related</h2>
	<h4>Goal: Conclude my work on dynamical effects of ACC and CG misaglinment knowledge based on GRACE data<h4>
	<p>currently drafting a "Technical Note" in AIAA's specification aiming for publication</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Math for Fun</h2>		
	<h4>Goal: Get senses on some details about Atiyah-Singer Index theorem<h4>
	<p>started reading friend Daniel's undergrad honor thesis</p>

	<h4>Goal: Understand the historical context and motivation of Lie theory<h4>
	<p>started skimming through Hawkin's Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups</p>

	<h4>Goal: idk<h4>
	<p>still reading the "What is" columns and more of the Princeton Companion <emph>slowly</emph>...</p>
	<p>figure out meaning behind mapping class group / beat Teruaki</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Other</h2>
	<h4>Goal: Explore alternatives<h4>
	<p>try reading this old book about time series prediction per Dr. Bettadpur's suggestion</p>
	<p>pick up more fundamentals on algorithms, hopefully work on things that Google recruiter suggested to prepare</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">GRAD APPS AND STUFF!!!</h2>
