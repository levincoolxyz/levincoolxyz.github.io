	<h1>Current Activities</h1>
	<p>This page is as much of a status update as a personal agenda/reminder......</p>
	<p><em>Updated 04/09/2016</em></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Work</h2>
	<p>studying a version of the 2d(genus 0 surface) inverse spectral problem for/with <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/evouga/">Prof. Vouga</a>. some preliminary codes <a href="https://github.com/levincoolxyz/invspec">here</a>.</p>
	<p>still tagging along <a href="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/neitzke/teaching/392C-higgs-bundles/">Prof. Neitzke's Higgs Bundle</a>, <a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/benzvi/teaching/alggeom/syllabus.html">Prof. BenZvi's AG</a>, Prof. Allcock's Kac-Moody algebra, and <a href="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/perutz/RiemannSurfaces.html">Prof. Perutz's Riemann Surfaces</a> classes.<br/>
	It has been a trip!<br/>
	Arun's <a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/a.debray/lecture_notes/">live-TeX notes</a> summarizes some of these courses' spirits pretty well.</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Readings (mildly hindered by a lack of UT library privileges)</h2>
	<h4>Topology!</h4>
	<p>never gonna give May's super concise course up</p>
	<p>still around chapter 2 of Adam's infinite loop spaces</p>
	<p>intermittently reading Bott and Tu's forms in AT, Milnor's char classes, cohomology operations, the wild world of 4 mflds, algebraic operads ...</p>

	<h4>discrete/combinatorial/computational Geometry</h4>
	<p>Prof. Keenan Crane's Discrete Differential Geometry notes was gr8</p>
	<p>was working on Bobenko & Suris' DDG book. Nets!</p>
	<p>also was reading "Using the Borsuk-Ulam theorem"</p>

	<h4>Algebraic Geometry</h4>
	<p>BenZvi's lectures have been super helpful</p>
	<p>about to work through Shafarevich and Hartshorne again now equipped with more topology and intuitions...</p>
	<p>started bits and pieces (mostly the chapter about Gröbner basis) of Eisenbud's Comm. Alg.</p>
	<p>picking up Viosin's Hodge theory book again</p>

	<h4>Other</h4>
	<p>reading about topological signal processing and how sheaf cohomology is useful for that</p>
	<p>started some noncommutative geometry notes online</p>
	<p>reading Daniel Chupin's undergrad thesis on heat kernel proof of the AS index theorem</p>
	<p>continue Lieb & Seiringer's stability of matter in QM</p>
	<p>review readings and notes from Freed's K-theory class, particularly the parts about Clifford algebra and rep/Lie theory. also Atiyah's K-theory</p>
	<p>review notes from Gompf's 4-mfd class and his book, complementing with Akbulut's lecture notes, aiming to get Kirby calculus down better</p>
	<p>review notes and references from Gunningham's D-module class</p>
	<p>same for Blumberg's Homotopy type theory class from wayyy back, maybe catch up some recent results</p>
	<p>skimming through Hawkin's Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups</p>
	<p>Programming Pearls</p>
	<p>get the point of pointless topology</p>
	<p>keep on slogging thru the "What is" columns compilation and the Princeton Companion...</p>

	<p>Also see <a href="/todo.html">a list of concepts to be tackled.</a></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2>
	<p>figure out how to work genus 2 Dehn twists to beat Teruaki</p>
	<p>try to rigorously explain when are repetitions of simple K'nex angle joints planar</p>
	<p>Learn España Cañí, Sting's the last ship, Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Radiohead's Street Spirit, and perfect ze Spanish Romance (cf. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5tEd16aBCY">this performance</a>).</p>
	<p>restart regular piano practices</p>
	<p>training for a 5K (Rock n' Roll "marathon" in Dallas) on March 18</p>
	<p>organize photos, finish the photography page, make an "album" on just the metal earth models...</p>
	<p>started hoarding facts from past Ig-noble prizes. <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/282526/3/MO_1007.pdf">this</a> one is my favorite yet. I wonder how does hunger factor into decision making. I image it would stop inhibitors on impulsive actions?<br/>
	Interestingly, my questions about <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxMc7PG7EAt-RjN4Y2pRODB3XzA">a hair curling procedure</a> led me to the pony tail dynamics Ig-noble prizes</p>
	<p>I have a very long IMDb watch list (409 and counting...)</p>
