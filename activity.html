<h1>Activities (2018) </h1>
	<p>This page is as much of a status update as a personal agenda/reminder......</p>
	<p><em>Updated 02/03/2018</em></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Research</h2>
	<p>I simulate active microfilaments. Click <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gluhphk5kcmdzhk/AACXRlXGf1tWAXwpxI-i1FxEa?dl=0">here</a> for some funky animations. And <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/15i3qjpad4q3dim/pres_swf.pdf?dl=0">these</a> are some slides on the main results (includes *.swf movies).</p>

	<p>Still owe <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/evouga/">Prof. Etienne Vouga</a> and <a href="http://keenan.is/here">Prof. Keenan Crane</a> a write up on the discrete inverse spectral problem for closed g=0 surfaces. I have a public project page <a href="/invspec">here</a>.</p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">Readings</h2>
	<h4>For Leisure (e.g. pure math)</h4>
	<p>A survey of minimal surfaces</p>
	<p>This nice note of Étienne Ghys (A Singular Mathematical Promenade) that starts from a cool proof of Konsevich and goes on to most everything I knew/heard about pure math.</p>
	<p>the Harvard notes Prof. Fokas kindly sent to me about the more "mathematical" backgrounds of his general PDE BVP analytic AND computational methods. Still flabergasted by "there's no inherently discrete spectra."</p>
	<p>Riemann Zeta Function by Edwards</p>
	<p>probably will pause May's super concise course for now</p>
	<p>VERY intermittently on Adam's infinite loop spaces, Bott and Tu's forms in AT, Milnor's char classes and morse theory, cohomology operations, algebraic operads, the wild world of 4 mflds ...</p>
	<p>a wish to retain BenZvi's 'basket' as long as possible by revisiting notes/Vakil/Shafarevich/Hartshorne...</p>
	<p>bits and pieces (mostly the chapter about Gröbner basis) of Eisenbud's Comm. Alg.</p>
	<p>sheaf cohomology in topological signal processing </p>
	<p>noncommutative geometry</p>
	<p>Daniel Chupin's heat kernel AS index thesis</p>
	<p>K-theory: Freed's class note and Antiyah's book and Quillen's side of the story</p>
	<p>I really want to get to know 4-mflds better. Gompf's book, notes, and that of Akbulut's. Kirby calculus will be conquered (before I die)</p>
	<p>get the point of pointless topology</p>
	<p>Lieb & Seiringer's stability of matter in QM</p>
	<p>"What is" columns and the Princeton Companion are now officially my bedtime stories...</p>

	<p>Also see <a href="/todo.html">a list of concepts to be tackled.</a></p>

	<h2 style="color:rgb(250,0,100) !important;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2>
	<p>am sticking to DTLAW for olympic lifts. have been able to back squat 2x BW but only very slow progress for snatches and cleans. I got chicken arms.</p>
	<p>Still no pianos but have guitar back. Chords Delilah Rising sun ...... many "etudes" to conquer</p>
	<p>A forum-less IMDb means a very long theMovieDB watch list and an ongoing battle for TV addictions</p>
